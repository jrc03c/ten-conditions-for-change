{"intro":[{"title":"INTRODUCTION","content":"<p>To solve many of the most pressing problems in the world, it will be necessary to help people create new positive behaviors. Whether your goal is to improve mental health, stop global warming, or mitigate risks from advanced technologies, behavior change challenges will stand in the way. Sometimes, these challenges will involve the behaviors of individuals, consumers, or aid recipients. Other times, they will involve the behaviors of politicians, government officials, or CEOs. You may also need to apply these strategies to yourself to solve problems in your own life.</p>\n<p>Yet behavior change frequently fails. Why does it fail? And what can you do to make it more likely to succeed?</p>\n<p>We’ve created the Ten Conditions for Change framework to help answer these questions. We hope this framework will enhance your efforts to improve the world, or to change your own life for the better.</p>\n<p>There are, of course, a number of useful behavior change frameworks already in existence. With that fact in mind, we’ve specifically aimed to create a framework that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>can easily be applied to practical problems</strong> in a step-by-step fashion by individuals and teams, regardless of their level of experience designing behavior change interventions; and that…</li>\n<li><strong>provides a comprehensive system</strong> that can account for the huge range of different techniques used in practice (i.e., not simplifying the realm of consideration to a limited number of techniques).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At the bottom of this page, we also provide simplified summaries of a number of other behavior change frameworks, and explain how each relates to our Ten Conditions for Change model.</p>\n","id":"5sxf05cot0o1hz1gbyyjlu58c8aswxrn"},{"title":"OVERVIEW","content":"<p>This framework provides ten “conditions for change” that are designed to be <em>sufficient</em> for succeeding at creating a new positive behavior. That is, we provide ten conditions that are very likely to produce behavior change if the intended person or population meets all of them. This structure also implies that any person who is failing to carry out a desired behavior change likely isn’t meeting one or more of these ten conditions. If you can increase the likelihood of meeting these conditions, you can increase the chance that behavior change will occur. By “condition” in this context, we mean “a state of affairs that must be satisfied in order for a particular outcome to occur.” In other words, we think that behavior change is likely to occur when these ten states of affairs are satisfied.</p>\n<p>That means that this framework provides a systematic way to analyze a desired behavior for a desired person or population, and then to develop a strategy to increase the chance of successful adoption of the behavior. It also provides a method for analyzing why the behavior is not occurring already.</p>\n<p>This framework is specifically designed for positive, “complex” behaviors which require the target person or population to engage willingly in the change and to perform multiple actions across time.</p>\n<p>The Ten Conditions for Change framework provides a way of organizing and systematizing thinking about behavior change. There are numerous behavior change strategies—so many that it’s hard to know where to begin. This framework can help you identify those strategies that are most appropriate for your situation and mission. Furthermore, it’s easy to miss important considerations in behavior change projects, and these overlooked considerations may ultimately lead to failure. By using this systematic process, we think you will be less likely to overlook important details regarding what you need to make your behavior change efforts succeed.</p>\n<hr class=\"little\">\n<p><strong>Structure</strong></p>\n<p>The framework is organized into three main phases: <span class=\"is-highlighted is-orange\">DECISION</span>, <span class=\"is-highlighted is-green\">ACTION</span>, and <span class=\"is-highlighted is-purple\">CONTINUATION</span>. The ten conditions together make up these three phases. Here again is an outline of the whole framework:</p>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: upper-roman\">\n\t<li><span class=\"is-highlighted is-orange\">DECISION</span></li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n\t<ol>\n\t\t<li><u>Considers</u> changing the behavior</li>\n\t\t<li><u>Desires</u> changing the behavior</li>\n\t\t<li><u>Intends</u> to change the behavior</li>\n\t</ol>\n</ol>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: upper-roman\" start=\"2\">\n\t<li><span class=\"is-highlighted is-green\">ACTION</span></li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n\t<ol start=\"4\">\n\t\t<li><u>Remembers</u> to perform each action</li>\n\t\t<li><u>Believes</u> performing each action will help achieve the goal</li>\n\t\t<li><u>Chooses</u> to perform each action</li>\n\t\t<li><u>Knows</u> how to perform each action</li>\n\t\t<li><u>Has</u> needed resources to perform each action</li>\n\t\t<li><u>Embodies</u> skills and traits needed to perform each action</li>\n\t</ol>\n</ol>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: upper-roman\" start=\"3\">\n\t<li><span class=\"is-highlighted is-purple\">CONTINUATION</span></li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n\t<ol start=\"10\">\n\t\t<li><u>Maintains</u> attributes required to perform future needed actions</li>\n\t</ol>\n</ol>\n<p>The <span class=\"is-highlighted is-orange\">DECISION</span> phase refers to conditions that are sufficient for a person to decide to change their behavior. For instance, if someone smokes cigarettes habitually, they’ll have to make a <em>decision to quit</em> before they’ll <em>take action to quit</em>. Often, a decision only needs to be made once; but if the target person later changes their mind about changing their behavior, then the decision will need to be re-made.</p>\n<p>The <span class=\"is-highlighted is-green\">ACTION</span> phase refers to conditions that are sufficient for a person to perform the various actions that together constitute a successful behavior change. Most complex behaviors will involve taking a number of different actions which are spread out across time, and the <span class=\"is-highlighted is-green\">ACTION</span> phase should be applied to each of these actions separately. For instance, if someone is trying to completely quit smoking, they may have to change their behavior of buying cigarettes and their behavior of borrowing cigarettes from people at events, and perhaps also replace the habitual action of smoking with some alternative action instead.</p>\n<p>The <span class=\"is-highlighted is-purple\">CONTINUATION</span> phase refers to conditions that are sufficient for a person to continue the <span class=\"is-highlighted is-orange\">DECISION</span> and <span class=\"is-highlighted is-green\">ACTION</span> processes (that is, to prevent those conditions from failing to be met after initial actions are performed and as time passes). So, for instance, if a person avoids smoking cigarettes one time but finds the experience so frustrating that it changes their opinion about quitting, or if a person’s motivation for quitting cigarettes falls over time, then the <span class=\"is-highlighted is-purple\">CONTINUATION</span> phase would involve diagnosing and fixing the person’s negative attitudes or lack of motivation so that they can re-make the <span class=\"is-highlighted is-orange\">DECISION</span> to quit and then re-perform the <span class=\"is-highlighted is-green\">ACTIONs</span> required to quit.</p>\n<hr class=\"little\">\n<p><strong>Statuses</strong></p>\n<p>Each of the conditions can have one of three statuses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>met</strong> = this condition is already met, is likely to be met, or is usually met by the target population; therefore this condition should <em>not</em> be a target for improvement</li>\n<li><strong>unmet</strong> = this condition is not met, is unlikely to be met, or is often not met by the target population; therefore this condition <em>should</em> be a target for improvement</li>\n<li><strong>unknown</strong> = it is unknown whether or not this condition is met; therefore more research is needed to understand whether this condition should be a target for improvement</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you’re thinking about trying to get someone (yourself or a target population) to adopt a new, positive behavior, consider the status of each of the ten conditions relative to that behavior. If a condition has already been met, then you will most likely not need to focus on it in your behavioral intervention. If a condition has not been met, then you’ll want to select and apply interventions to ensure that the condition gets met.</p>\n<p>It’s also important to note that the above statuses aren’t black and white: it’s possible that a condition might be met 70% of the time, or met by just 70% of the population, or unknown among 70% of the population, etc.  Thus, it may be necessary to set thresholds for the statuses to determine that a condition is met well enough that it is no longer a bottleneck for the behavior. For example, you might say to yourself, “When 70% of the population meets a condition, I’ll consider that condition to have been ‘met.’” Or, “A condition will no longer have a status of ‘unknown’ once I have information about at least 70% of the population.” It is unlikely that 100% of the population will meet a condition 100% of the time, and waiting for such an ideal state of affairs is unrealistic in many situations. The key question is: “Has this condition been met to a sufficient degree that it is no longer preventing adoption of the new, positive behavior?”</p>\n<p>If you’re not sure whether or not a condition has been met, then it’s very important to gather more information in order to figure out whether it needs to be a focus. If you decide that you need to gather more information about a particular condition, then consider possible information gathering methods, like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>interviewing or surveying the target population to understand their current behaviors and the forces that drive their behaviors</li>\n<li>discussing the matter with experts</li>\n<li>reading academic studies and papers</li>\n<li>analyzing the data you may already have collected from existing users, or analyzing data that others have collected on the target population</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Select and implement whichever information gathering methods seems most likely to answer the question about how well the condition has been met.</p>\n<hr class=\"little\">\n<p><strong>Other Considerations</strong></p>\n<p>In practice, given your role, your resources, and the nature of the problem, you may only be capable of influencing some of the ten conditions in this framework and not others. Similarly, not all of the conditions are equally likely to improve. If multiple conditions for change are not met, you will likely want to focus first on the one or two that would be easiest or most cost-effective to change; but it may still be worth analyzing the other remaining conditions anyway to make sure that the conditions outside of your control don’t doom your project to failure.</p>\n<p>If a previous behavior change project failed, going through this list of ten conditions can also help you figure out why it failed. Ask yourself: “Which of the conditions likely weren’t satisfied, therefore causing the target population to fail to adopt the target behavior?”</p>\n","id":"g7a2ypaeyed9dv0nhzvjw8g0nvsaysqs"},{"title":"HOW TO USE THIS FRAMEWORK","content":"<p>The Ten Conditions for Change framework can be used for two purposes. First, it can be used to create a new behavior in a target population; and second, it can be used to perform a “postmortem” analysis to try to figure out why a past attempted behavior change failed.</p>\n<p>Here is a step-by-step guide for using the Ten Conditions for Change to create a new, beneficial behavior:</p>\n<hr class=\"little\">\n<p><strong>Step 1: Choose a Target Population</strong></p>\n<p>Select a population or person (it could be yourself!) who you are aiming to benefit via positive behavior change.</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Perhaps your target population is children in your region who are suffering from high numbers of cases of Hepatitis B.</p>\n<hr class=\"little\">\n<p><strong>Step 2: Consider the Desired Outcomes &amp; Brainstorm Behaviors</strong></p>\n<p>If you have already selected the behavior you are aiming to create in the target population, and you are confident it is a good choice to produce positive outcomes (relative to its difficulty of implementation) skip now to step 4.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, we recommend writing down the primary positive outcome or benefit that you’re aiming to create for the target population.</p>\n<p>Once you have done that, brainstorm a list of many possible new behaviors (or behaviors that are currently only done infrequently) that could lead to that positive outcome or benefit.</p>\n<p>After you’ve come up with this list of possible target behaviors, for each one consider:</p>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha;\">\n\t<li>how much benefit it would create for the target population if they were to engage in this behavior reliably, and</li>\n\t<li>how difficult it would be to create that behavior.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> If your target outcome is a reduction in cases of Hepatitis B among children in your region, you might consider target behaviors like (i) parental testing (to prevent transmission to children), (ii) early childhood vaccination, or (iii) adolescent vaccination.</p>\n<hr class=\"little\">\n<p><strong>Step 3: Select the Behavior</strong></p>\n<p>Of the list of concrete, positive behaviors you brainstormed, pick the one that you believe has the best ratio of positive outcomes for your target population relative to its difficulty of implementation.</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> If you hope to fight Hepatitis B, and parents in your region often don’t vaccinate their children, then you might decide that the behavior you want to create is for parents to bring their children in for Hepatitis B vaccinations at the appropriate times.</p>\n<hr class=\"little\">\n<p><strong>Step 4: Consider the <span class=\"is-highlighted is-orange\">DECISION</span> Conditions</strong></p>\n<p>Now we are going to apply the <span class=\"is-highlighted is-orange\">DECISION</span> phase of the Ten Conditions for Change framework to the behavior that you selected. For each of the three conditions for change in the <span class=\"is-highlighted is-orange\">DECISION</span> phase, ask yourself, “To what extent is this condition met by this person?” or “What percentage of people in this population meet this condition?”</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> If parents in your target region largely don’t know about Hepatitis B vaccines for children, then you’ll need to help them meet the “Considers” condition. If they do know about the vaccine but don’t understand the benefit of vaccination, then you’ll need to help them meet the “Desires” condition. If parents do want to vaccinate their children but don’t know when or where to get the vaccines, and hence have no plan to follow through on vaccinating their children, then you’ll need to help them meet the “Intends” condition.</p>\n<hr class=\"little\">\n<p><strong>Step 5: Break the Behavior into <span class=\"is-highlighted is-green\">ACTION</span> Sequences</strong></p>\n<p>Then, break the behavior down into a series of actions that a person can perform to fully succeed at the behavior.</p>\n<p>Note that most complex behaviors will require a number of different actions to be performed. Furthermore, there might be multiple sequences of actions that could lead a person to succeed at this behavior, so you’ll want to choose the sequence of actions that is easiest to implement and that is still sufficient for engaging in the desired behavior. Ask yourself, “Of all of the sequences of actions that could produce this behavior, which one makes the most sense in this situation? Which one is easiest to carry out?”</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Vaccination might be accomplished in multiple ways. In some areas, both doctors and drugstores offer vaccination. In some cases, insurance companies may have to be consulted. You may decide that, given the particulars of your target region, visiting a local doctor who will bill the vaccination to a person’s insurance company makes the most sense and is the easiest and most cost-effective course of action for most people. Also, the HepB vaccine in particular requires three separate doses at zero, one, and six to twelve months after birth. So, a prescribed sequence of actions might be: (1) Allow doctors to administer the first dose within twenty-four hours of birth in the hospital (unless the child has a low birth weight, in which case postpone all doses by a month); (2) visit your local family doctor or pediatrician for the second dose a month after the child is born; and (3) visit your local family doctor or pediatrician for the third dose six months after the child is born.</p>\n<hr class=\"little\">\n<p><strong>Step 6: Consider the <span class=\"is-highlighted is-green\">ACTION</span> Conditions</strong></p>\n<p>Once you have settled on a sequence of actions that constitute the positive behavior, then you’ll want to think about those actions individually. For each distinct type of action, consider each of the six conditions for change in the <span class=\"is-highlighted is-green\">ACTION</span> phase, and ask yourself, “To what extent is this condition met by this person?” or “What percentage of people in this population meet this condition?”</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> If parents allow the first dose to be administered in the hospital but will likely forget the second and third doses, then you’ll need to help them meet the “Remembers” condition. If parents don’t understand why three doses are necessary, then you’ll need to help them meet the “Believes” condition. If parents are inclined to put off the latter doses, then you’ll need to help them meet the “Chooses” condition. If parents don’t have health insurance and don’t know how to sign up for it, then you’ll need to help them meet the “Has” and “Knows” conditions. If the parents don’t speak the local language, then you’ll need to help them meet the “Embodies” condition. (The main type of action in the case of vaccination is visiting the doctor to receive the vaccination; if there were multiple types of actions, then you’d need to consider the above conditions for each type.)</p>\n<hr class=\"little\">\n<p><strong>Step 7: Consider the <span class=\"is-highlighted is-purple\">CONTINUATION</span> Condition</strong></p>\n<p>Then, review the condition for change in the <span class=\"is-highlighted is-purple\">CONTINUATION</span> phase, and ask yourself, “Is it likely that the conditions in the <span class=\"is-highlighted is-orange\">DECISION</span> and <span class=\"is-highlighted is-green\">ACTION</span> phase may shift for the worse as time passes or as some of the actions are completed? If so, when, where, and how will the process break down in the future?”</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> If any of the above conditions might become un-met as time passes, then you’ll have to find ways to help parents re-meet those conditions. For example, if children have negative reactions to the first doses of the vaccine and parents become worried about allowing their children to receive the second and third doses, then you’ll have to find ways to help them re-meet the “Desires,” “Believes,” and/or “Chooses” conditions. Or if the government decides to stop subsidizing healthcare and a significant portion of the population loses access to health insurance, then you’ll have to find ways to help them re-meet the “Has” condition.</p>\n<hr class=\"little\">\n<p><strong>Step 8: Choose Strategies</strong></p>\n<p>As you review all of the conditions mentioned, keep in mind that it often turns out that some of the conditions will already be met automatically and so require no work, whereas others will only be met if appropriate interventions are used.</p>\n<p>The conditions for change that you think are not already well met provide hypotheses about how to increase the chance that the behavior will be changed. For each condition that is not well met, consider the provided example strategies for improving that condition, or brainstorm your own strategies. Consider which strategies seem promising regarding the intended behavior change for the intended population given each strategy’s likelihood of success and difficulty of implementation. Now, ask yourself, “Given all of the conditions for change that are not well met and all of the relevant strategies for meeting that condition, which would be the most effective for me to work on? Which do I predict will provide the biggest expected improvements in behavior change relative to their cost, effort, or difficulty of implementation?”</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> If parents don’t know about the HepB vaccine at all, then (to help them meet the “Considers” condition) you might run an ad campaign on TV or on a major social network. If parents are likely to forget about the second and third dose appointments, then (to help them meet the “Remembers” condition) you might remind them with text message, email, and phone call reminders. If parents falsely believe that the vaccine will cause their children to develop autism, then (to help them meet the “Desires,” “Believes,” and/or “Chooses” conditions) you might develop and distribute a free pamphlet that obstetricians can give to new mothers that clearly explains the benefits of vaccinations.</p>\n","id":"py5u428zryea087a5dh75yr2suiu728m"}],"preface":{"title":"PREFACE","content":"<p>Behavior change is hard.

They sought to test the following hypotheses (put forward by System Justification Theory) that disadvantaged groups will display outgroup favoritism, especially in certain circumstances, such as when studies use impicit measures (as opposed to explicit measures), when they consciously report system justifying beliefs, and when their group is viewed more negatively by society. In line with the theory, Essien, Calanchini, & Degner found evidence that disadvantaged groups have an imiplicit outgroup favoritism and a small degree of explicit ingroup favoritism, with effects varying according to the intergroup domain (e.g., whether people were disadvantaged due to being in a numerical minority, of a lower socioeconomic status, lacking access to resources, or belonging to a stigmatized group). They also found that conservatism (endorsement of system-justifying beliefs) moderated impicit and explicit intergroup evaluations. Furthermore, at the level of social groups, disadvantaged groups who were viewed more negatively in their social context also displayed higher levels of outgroup favoritism.","wasEvidenceCopypastedFromSomewhereIfSoHasThisBeenEditedOrIsTheInfoNotRelevantusefulAndAbleToBeDeletedTemporaryColumn":"This has been reworded.

If a beneficial behavior is seen as unnatural, provide evidence that it results in positive outcomes. If a detrimental behavior is seen as natural, provide evidence that it results in negative outcomes.\n- Be careful in the way that you counteract this fallacy, especially in cases where it is deeply connected to a person's worldview. If a person views humans as being a fundamentally different from animals, then man-made things will take on a particularly significant quality (that they would otherwise not have if the person were to view humans as merely being another kind of animal). For example, are skyscrapers \"natural\"? If one views humans as just another kind of animal, then comparing skyscrapers to anthills might seem appropriate; but to a person who views humans as being metaphysically different than animals, such a comparison might seem degrading to humans or even simply absurd. In other words, if a person is a materialist who believes that nature is just everything that is, then skyscrapers and vaccines and sodas are just as \"natural\" as anthills and venom and honey. But a person who believes that humans are separate from nature will probably view man-made things with some amount of mistrust. And, of course, challenging a person's worldview is extremely difficult and likely to backfire.

If a person views humans as being a fundamentally different from animals, then man-made things will take on a particularly significant quality (that they would otherwise not have if the person were to view humans as merely being another kind of animal). For example, are skyscrapers “natural”? If one views humans as just another kind of animal, then comparing skyscrapers to anthills might seem appropriate; but to a person who views humans as being metaphysically different than animals, such a comparison might seem degrading to humans or even simply absurd. In other words, if a person is a materialist who believes that nature is just everything that is, then skyscrapers and vaccines and sodas are just as “natural” as anthills and venom and honey. But a person who believes that humans are separate from nature will probably view man-made things with some amount of mistrust. And, of course, challenging a person’s worldview is extremely difficult and likely to backfire.

Thus, only when the person seems highly representative of a category is that category judged as more probable than its superordinate category. For example, the probability of being either a physics or a biology major is at least as likely as being a physics major, if not more likely. However, when a personality description (data) seems to be very representative of a physics major (e.g., pocket protector) over a biology major, people judge that it is more likely for this person to be a physics major than a natural sciences major (which is a superset of physics).

If the doctor just takes into consideration the accuracy of the test, then they might conclude that the patient is 99% likely to have the cancer. But this neglects the fact that very few people have the cancer (that is, the base rate of the cancer is low). Out of 10,000 randomly selected people, only 1 of them, on average, will have the cancer.

So benefits in one minute are valued more than benefits tomorrow, which are valued more than benefits in one year. One type of discounting is hyperbolic discounting, according to which how much people care about future benefits \"fall relatively rapidly for earlier delay periods (as in, from now to one week), but then fall more slowly for longer delay periods (for instance, more than a few days). For example, in a study subjects said they would be indifferent between receiving $15 immediately or $30 after 3 months, $60 after 1 year, or $100 after 3 years. These indifferences reflect annual discount rates that declined from 277% to 139% to 63% as delays got longer. This contrasts with exponential discounting, in which valuation falls by a constant factor per unit delay and the discount rate stays the same.\" Another effect of hyperbolic discounting is that \"many people prefer $100 now to $110 in a day, but very few people prefer $100 in 30 days to $110 in 31 days.\" In other words: \"More generally, the rate at which people discount future rewards declines as the length of the delay increases\". When the intrinsic benefit of the behavior change is delayed in time (for example, if a person is trying to lose weight the goal will take at least months to be met), people are more likely to choose to not perform the desired action for the immediate pleasure / reward (eating a bowl of ice cream) because of excessively high rates of discounting, so interventions to address this have to make the delayed reward more desirable or build in immediate rewards (e.g., marking one more day of eating healthy on a tracker).","TEN CONDITIONS FOR CHANGE":"6.

Whether a transaction is framed as a loss or a gain is very important: would you rather get a $5 discount (win), or avoid a $5 surcharge (loss)?

Roughly, participants who found tasks to be relatively easy erroneously assumed, to some extent, that the tasks must also be easy for others.\n\nStudies on the Dunning–Kruger Effect tend to focus on American test subjects. Similar studies on European subjects show marked muting of the effect; studies on some East Asian subjects suggest that something like the opposite of the Dunning–Kruger effect operates on self-assessment and motivation to improve.

When the subjects believed that the writers freely chose positions for or against Castro, they would normally rate the people who liked Castro as having a more positive attitude towards Castro. However, contradicting Jones and Harris' initial hypothesis, when the subjects were told that the writers' positions were determined by a coin toss, they still rated writers who spoke in favor of Castro as having, on average, a more positive attitude towards Castro than those who spoke against him. In other words, the subjects were unable to properly see the influence of the situational constraints placed upon the writers; they could not refrain from attributing sincere belief to the writers.

Rosenstock, Godfrey M. Hochbaum, S. Stephen Kegeles, and Howard Leventhal</a> for the U.S. Public Health Service, to understand the failure of screening and health prevention programs. Since then, it has been used to predict and affect a wide array of health behaviors from acceptance of immunizations to adherence to medical treatments and adoption of healthy lifestyle choices. Rosenstock states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In order for Behavioral Change to succeed, people must have an incentive to take action, feel threatened by their current behavioral patterns and believe that change of a specific kind will be beneficial by resulting in a valued outcome at acceptable cost, but they must also feel themselves competent to implement that change.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, there are several variables that affect a person’s willingness to change their behavior:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perceived threat</strong>: The combination of two factors:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perceived susceptibility</strong>—the subjective assessment of the likelihood of developing a health problem.</li>\n<li><strong>Perceived severity</strong>—how serious the person believes that the threat is.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Perceived benefits</strong>: The belief that doing the behavior will lead to desired outcomes.</li>\n<li><strong>Perceived barriers</strong>: The perceived obstacles a person would face to perform the behavior, such as financial costs, phobic reactions, physical barriers, side-effects, accessibility factors, and personality characteristics.</li>\n<li><strong>Self-efficacy</strong>: This variable was <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/109019818801500203\" target=\"_blank\">added to the model in the 1980s</a> and refers to an individual’s belief in his or her capacity to execute specific behaviors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The model asserts that a person’s beliefs and perceptions are affected by <strong>modifying factors</strong>: demographic, socio-psychological, and structural variables like sex, age, income level, or education level. It also highlights the need for <strong>cues to action</strong>, which are the instigating events that set the behavior change process in motion. They can either be internal (e.g., a person starting to feel sick) or external (e.g., a conversation with a physician or something read in social media). If the perceived threat is low, the required intensity of the cue is high.</p>\n<p><strong>Connection</strong>: The behavior change strategies that would make the threat salient as well as those that provide external cues to action help meet the Considers condition in our framework. Perceived benefits are key to meeting the Desires condition, and self-efficacy relates to the Intends condition if it is about the behavior as a whole (e.g., a person believing that they can lose weight) and to the Believes condition if it is about specific actions towards the desired behavior (e.g., a person believing they can avoid buying unhealthy food when they go shopping). Strategies that aim to reduce the perceived barriers mostly relate to the Has, Knows, and Embodies conditions (and to the Chooses and Remembers conditions to some extent).</p>\n","id":"8u5vgh8018jai1d4ib6g8jw5tlcajul1"},{"title":"Transtheoretical Model (1977)","year":1977,"content":"<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transtheoretical_model\" target=\"_blank\">Transtheoretical Model</a> (TTM) of behavior change, originally developed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_O._Prochaska\" target=\"_blank\">James O. Prochaska</a> and Carlo Di Clemente, evaluates a person’s readiness to engage in a new healthier behavior, and gives strategies to guide the change process.

There are three main mediating cognitions in the Motivational Phase:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Risk Perception</strong> is useful to create a contemplative process (e.g., “smoking kills”), but it alone does not form an intention.</li>\n<li><strong>Outcome Expectancies</strong> are subjective beliefs about the result of the behavior change (e.g., “If I quit smoking, my overall health will improve”). More positive and less negative outcome expectancies will result in greater likelihood that a person develops an intention.</li>\n<li><strong>Action Self-Efficacy</strong> is a person’s belief that they are able to adopt a behavior change (e.g., “I can quit smoking if I try”).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As soon as a person has an intention to change their behavior, they have to develop a plan to put it in action. Once the change has been planned and initiated, it has to be maintained. This phase, the Volitional Phase, involves these four mediating cognitions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Action Planning</strong> fills the gap between intention and action, and requires developing “detailed action plans of when, where, and how to perform the desired action”. It involves taking into account that some health behavior changes require one individual action (like receiving an immunization shot), whereas others require a recurring action (like exercising regularly).</li>\n<li><strong>Coping Planning</strong> involves identifying obstacles that may get in the way of a behavior change and determining what to do if those obstacles present themselves. For example, if the plan is to go to the gym three times per week and the person will be going on vacation soon, they should come up with a plan to exercise while being away.</li>\n<li><strong>Maintenance Self-Efficacy</strong> represents a person’s optimistic beliefs that they will overcome obstacles that arise during the maintenance phase (e.g., “I feel confident that, when I’m anxious, I will be able to resist the desire to smoke”).</li>\n<li><strong>Recovery Self-Efficacy</strong> “addresses the experience of failure and recovery from setbacks.” (For example, “After months of not smoking, I had a rough week at work and I smoked every night. I feel confident that I can quit again.”)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Therefore, according to this framework, individuals pass through different mindsets on their way to behavior change: people in the Motivational Phase are identified as <em>non-intenders</em>, and those in the Volitional Phase are either <em>intenders</em>—if they are in the process of planning but have not yet initiated the action—or <em>actors</em>. When designing interventions, it is important to tailor them to the group that the target individuals belong to.</p>\n<p><strong>Connection</strong>: Both the HAPA and the Ten Conditions for Change frameworks provide descriptions of how people move through different stages as they change behaviors. The DECISION phase of the Ten Conditions for Change framework relates to the Motivational Phase in the HAPA, and the ACTION and CONTINUATION phases relate to the Volitional phase. But whereas planning interventions (Action Planning and Coping Planning) fall under the Volitional Phase in the HAPA framework, those interventions help meet the Intends condition in the DECISION phase of our framework. Risk Perception and Outcome Expectancies, cognitions of the Motivational Phase, may be used to meet the Considers and Desires conditions. Action Planning, Coping Planning, and Self-Efficacy connect with the Intends, Knows, and Believes conditions, respectively, in our framework.</p>\n","id":"d4s45r9wausyvyt1ebxgmnq3umjrvq3k"},{"title":"Intervention Mapping (1998)","year":1998,"content":"<p>The <a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1030.4260&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Intervention Mapping</a> (IM) approach, by L.

It was first <a href=\"https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/14/1/26.full\" target=\"_blank\">published in 2005</a> but <a href=\"https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1748-5908-7-37\" target=\"_blank\">updated in 2012</a>. The initial aim of the framework “was to create an accessible and memorable summary of behavior change theory.” During its development, the scope of the TDF was limited to those domains which were determined to be “particularly relevant to (a) understanding and changing behavior in interdisciplinary research and (b) intervening to change the behavior of healthcare professionals.” Despite the initial focus on health professionals’ behavior, the TDF has subsequently been applied to other behavior change situations, including interventions pertaining to population health, occupational health, transportation, and the environment.</p>\n<p>The TDF consists of the following domains, each of which has a set of associated constructs listed beside them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Knowledge</strong>, which includes knowledge about condition / scientific rationale, schemas + mindsets + illness representations, procedural knowledge, and other knowledge</li>\n<li><strong>Skills</strong>, which includes skills themselves, competence / ability / skill assessment, practice / skills development, interpersonal skills, and coping strategies</li>\n<li><strong>Social / professional role and identity</strong>, which includes identity, professional identity / boundaries / role, group / social identity, social / group norms, and alienation / organizational commitment</li>\n<li><strong>Beliefs about capabilities</strong>, including self-efficacy, control of behavior and of resources, social environment, perceived competence, self-confidence / professional confidence, empowerment, self-esteem, perceived behavioral control, and optimism / pessimism</li>\n<li><strong>Beliefs about consequences</strong>, including outcome expectancies, anticipated regret, appraisal / evaluation / review, consequents, attitudes, contingencies, reinforcement / punishment / consequences, incentives / rewards, beliefs, unrealistic optimism, salient events / sensitisation / critical incidents, and characteristics of outcome expectancies (physical, social, and emotional, as well as whether outcomes are perceived as sanctions vs. rewards, proximal vs. distal, valued vs. not valued, probable vs. improbable, salient vs. not salient, and high vs. low-risk)</li>\n<li><strong>Motivation and goals</strong>, including the certainty and stability of a person’s intention(s), goals themselves, goal target(s) / setting(s), goal priority, intrinsic motivation, commitment, distal and proximal goals, and the transtheoretical model and relevant stages of change</li>\n<li><strong>Memory, attention, and decision processes</strong>, which includes memory, attention, attention control, and decision-making</li>\n<li><strong>Environmental context and resources</strong>, including availability and management of material resources, environmental stressors, person-environment interactions, and knowledge of task environment</li>\n<li><strong>Social influences</strong>, which includes social support, social / group norms, organizational development, leadership, teamwork, group conformity, organizational climate / culture, social pressure, power / hierarchy, professional boundaries / roles, management commitment, supervision, inter-group conflict, champions, social comparisons, identity (group / social identity), organizational commitment / alienation, feedback, conflict (competing demands and conflicting roles), change management, crew resource management, negotiation, social support (personal / professional / organizational, intra / interpersonal, society / community), social / group norms (subjective, descriptive, injunctive norms), and learning and modelling</li>\n<li><strong>Emotion</strong>, including affect, stress, anticipated regret, fear, burn-out, cognitive overload / tiredness, threat, positive / negative affect, and anxiety / depression</li>\n<li><strong>Behavioral regulation</strong>, including goal / target setting, implementation intentions, action planning, self-monitoring, goal priority, generating alternatives, feedback, moderators of intention-behavior gaps, project management, and barriers and facilitators</li>\n<li><strong>Optimism</strong>, which includes optimism, pessimism, unrealistic optimism, and identity</li>\n<li><strong>Intentions</strong>, which includes the stability of intentions, the transtheoretical model, and stages of change</li>\n<li><strong>Reinforcement</strong>, which includes rewards (proximal / distal, valued / not valued, probable / improbable), incentives, punishment, consequents, reinforcement, contingencies, and sanctions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To help researchers to make optimal use of TDF in implementing behavior change, <a href=\"https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13012-017-0605-9\" target=\"_blank\">a guide to using the TDF in practice</a> was published in 2017. The authors recommended that TDF-based implementation research should include the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Select and specify the target behavior(s):</strong> “Use documentary analysis or empirical research to identify and specify who should do what differently, to increase the uptake of evidence-based practice.”</li>\n<li><strong>Select the study design:</strong> “[The designs may] involve semi-structured individual interviews, focus group interviews, questionnaires, structured observations, documentary analysis, or consensus processes.”</li>\n<li><strong>Develop study materials:</strong> “Although materials from previous studies may be used as templates, materials should be adapted to be appropriate to the specified behavior(s) and context.”</li>\n<li><strong>Decide the sampling strategy:</strong> “For exploratory studies, a maximum variation approach is appropriate.”</li>\n<li><strong>Collect the data:</strong> “Published studies have used audio-recorded interviews (face-to-face or telephone; one-to-one or focus group) or questionnaires (paper-based or online).”</li>\n<li><strong>Analyse the data:</strong> “The objective is to identify the domains that are most relevant to the implementation problem being addressed and to populate those domains with context-relevant and behaviorally specific content.”</li>\n<li><strong>Report findings:</strong> “For interview studies, report presents tables that include illustrative quotations, specific beliefs identified (with frequencies, if appropriate), and classification into domains.”</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Connection:</strong> The domains of the TDF can be mapped onto our Ten Conditions for Change framework. The knowledge domain is especially relevant to the Considers condition in our DECISION phase and the Knows condition of our ACTION phase, and the skills domain is relevant to the Embodies condition of our ACTION phase. Beliefs about capabilities, beliefs about consequences, optimism, intentions, and goals are all relevant to the three conditions of our DECISION phase, as well as to the Believes, Chooses, and Embodies conditions of our ACTION phase. The domain of “memory, attention, and decision processes” is relevant to our DECISION phase, and to the Remembers, Chooses, and Embodies conditions of our ACTION phase. Moreover, all of our conditions for change can benefit from considering factors pertaining to the other TDF domains of behavioral regulation, social influences, social / professional role and identity, environmental context and resources, reinforcement, and emotion. Finally, all of the TDF domains could also be usefully applied when considering how to meet the Maintains condition during our CONTINUATION phase.</p>\n","id":"b1zamjqdjs56oli4grxnbaxezdw5lxt5"},{"title":"Intentional Change Theory (2006)","year":2006,"content":"<p>The <a href=\"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/02621710610678445/full/html\" target=\"_blank\">Intentional Change Theory</a> by <a href=\"https://weatherhead.case.edu/faculty/richard-boyatzis\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Boyatzis</a> starts with the premise that for a behavior change to be sustainable over time, it must be desired—that is, a person must want to change in order to do so. Intentional change is self-directed change in which the person is aware of the change and understands the process of change.</p>\n<p>The process of Intentional Change is based on five “discoveries” for the person who is changing their behavior that often occur as a surprise or an epiphany rather than as a smooth, linear event:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Ideal Self</strong>: The first “discovery” happens when a person finds who they want to be. It is “a personal vision that articulates a person’s dreams, aspirations and fantasies.” It is believed that intrinsic motives lead to sustained change more than extrinsic ones, hence the importance of this “discovery” which, according to Boyatzis, is often overlooked. There are different ways to envision the Ideal Self, such as talking with friends or mentors, meditating to visualize oneself as the person one wants to be, and seeking support among people who are also working on their vision of their own Ideal Self.</li>\n<li><strong>Who am I?</strong>: The second “discovery” happens when a person develops an accurate vision of who they are right now: their Current Self. It involves identifying their strengths and aspects of themselves that they want to keep and which will help them become their Ideal Self. Likewise, they should notice what they should change or transform. Making an assessment of the Current Self is challenging: a person may not notice things about themselves that are evident to other people, they may be in the process of changing without noticing it (the boiling frog syndrome), or there may be enablers in their environment who do not give them accurate feedback because they forgive undesired behaviors or do not care to see them improve. In order for the second “discovery” to happen, a person may request feedback from other people, take psychological tests, or reflect upon their core values and personal philosophy.</li>\n<li><strong>Learning Agenda</strong>: Once a person knows who they are—the Current Self—and who they want to be—the Ideal Self—they need to plan how they will move towards their vision. The third “discovery”—the Learning Agenda—is the planning of this journey towards the Ideal Self, which should be seen as personal development rather than as the setting of standard goals that the person must achieve. In doing so, personal standards of performance are set. Since they are relevant to the person undergoing change, the standards provide motivation towards sustainable change.</li>\n<li><strong>Experiment and Practice</strong>: The fourth “discovery” occurs when a person experiments with new behaviors and practices them in different contexts. At this point, the behavior change appears more linear, and improvement starts to be evident. Experiments and practice “are most effective when they occur in conditions in which the person feels safe,” unexposed, and not under pressure to succeed.</li>\n<li><strong>Resonant Relationships</strong>: The fifth “discovery” involves identifying people in a person’s environment who can help, support, and encourage behavior change process: they provide a sense of identity, guidance, and feedback, and they serve as models. They are also a key to preventing relapses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Intentional Change Theory states that for a person to achieve sustainable, desired change, they should loop through the first four “discoveries” explained above. The fifth “discovery,” relationships that help us learn, aid throughout the whole process. Each “discovery” can be used as a benchmark, and it is not recommended that one moves on to the next one until the current one has been properly addressed.</p>\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00670/full#B8\" target=\"_blank\">two physio-psychological states</a> in which people may find themselves as they are looping through the “discoveries”:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Positive Emotional Attractor (PEA): This state builds on positive emotions. When people are in this state, they think optimistically about the future and engage their dreams. They also focus on their strengths, are more open to experimentation, and foster positive relationships.</li>\n<li>Negative Emotional Attractor (NEA): This state is characterized by negative emotions such as fear, anxiety, sadness, anger, disgust, and despair. People in this state tend to focus on performance and outcomes: they react to a threat and take action; and once the threat is gone, they may find themselves taking up undesired behaviors again. Also, they notice their weaknesses more than their strengths.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Based on the above, it seems that a person should ideally be in the PEA. However, being in the NEA is useful for attaining focused attention, performing analytical tasks, and making decisions. Dejection-related emotions associated with the NEA may also sometimes help a person build their Ideal Self, but they need to be properly balanced with the PEA. Dissatisfaction can be a starting point for a person to realize that their Current Self does not align with their Ideal Self, but mainly they need the openness and hope that characterize the PEA in the process of sustainable change.</p>\n<p>Both states are self-regulating in the sense that once a person is in one of them, they will remain there until an event occurs. However, since the system is not fully efficient, their deterioration occurs over time. It is assumed that there has to be an intentional effort to remain in the PEA, as it is generally believed that negative emotions are stronger than positive ones.</p>\n<p>Finally, “sustainable change occurs at any level of human and social organization through the same Intentional Change Theory.” The primary difference when shifting from ICT at the individual level to a higher social structure is that the “discoveries” are defined at group level: the Ideal Self becomes a shared vision of the individuals in the group, and the group as a whole loops through the “discoveries.” These different levels of organization are connected through leadership and reference groups.</p>\n<p>Boyatzis states that the Intentional Change Theory, with the essential components and process of behavior change, shows the characteristics of a complex system:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ICT is <strong>non-linear</strong> because the five “discoveries” are tipping points in the process of change (i.e. the amount of output over a given time is not merely proportional to the amount of input).</li>\n<li>The property of <strong>self-organization</strong> manifests itself in the self-regulatory effect of the Positive and Negative Attractors.</li>\n<li>With respect to the <strong>formation of patterns</strong> that replicate at different levels in complex systems, ICT reproduces across social structures (person, dyad, team/family, organization, community, country/culture, and global).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Connection</strong>: A person creates a vision of their Ideal Self in the first “discovery” and identifies their Current Self in the second. When they measure one against the other and notice the differences between the two, the Considers condition of our framework can be met. The Ideal Self is built on a person’s dreams and aspirations, which motivates them to embark on the process of behavior change: this closely relates to the Desires condition in our framework. The third “discovery”—creating a learning agenda—is the link between vision and action; in our framework, this link is the Intends condition. The fourth “discovery”—experimentation and practice—corresponds to the Action phase in the Ten Conditions for Change framework: addressing the Action conditions (Remembers, Believes, Chooses, etc.) may therefore be helpful to make this “discovery.” Finally, the fifth “discovery”—resonant relationships—helps all other discoveries. In the Ten Conditions for Change, we also find that a person’s social environment can help them meet different conditions both in the Decision and Action phase: Desires (role models), Intends (public commitment), Chooses (praise when starting a task), Knows (teaching), Embodies (modeling of the behavior), and Maintains (support network).</p>\n","id":"pskeszrb9kbc2zij29r3ailg0xybno7w"},{"title":"Fogg Behavior Model (2007)","year":2007,"content":"<p>The <a href=\"http://behaviormodel.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Fogg Behavior Model</a> (FBM), created by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._J._Fogg\" target=\"_blank\">BJ Fogg</a>, suggests that three different ingredients are needed at a given moment in order for a behavior to occur, namely:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Motivation</em>, with core motivators being pleasure/pain, hope/fear, and social acceptance/rejection.</li>\n<li><em>Ability</em>, which is a measure of whether the task is easy or hard to do, and which takes into account expenditures of various “Simplicity Factors” needed to engage in the behavior, such as time, money, physical effort, brain cycles, social deviance, and non-routine.

Prompts can be “Facilitators,” which assist in a behavior (e.g., a software tooltip), “Signals,” which indicate to us that an event has occurred (e.g., a chime sound when you receive an email), or “Sparks,” which cause a sudden boost of motivation (e.g., a message with a sudden discount).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If a well-timed Prompt occurs when Motivation is sufficiently high relative to the level of Ability required, then the person is likely to succeed at engaging in the behavior.</p>\n<p><strong>Connection</strong>: The Fogg Behavior Model (FBM) relates to the Ten Conditions for Change framework in that our Desires, Believes, and Chooses conditions relate to the FBM Motivation ingredient; our Knows, Has, and Embodies conditions relate to the FBM Ability ingredient; and our Considers, Intends, and Remembers conditions relate to the FBM Prompts ingredient.</p>\n","id":"qhfy18ywavd4xls5717ely5q2tatwrzq"},{"title":"MINDSPACE (2009)","year":2009,"content":"<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bi.team/publications/mindspace/\" target=\"_blank\">MINDSPACE</a> framework is a checklist of potentially powerful influences on people’s behavior, originally designed for policy-makers by Paul Dolan, Michael Hallsworth, David Halpern, Dominic King, and Ivo Vlaev. It was used by the <a href=\"https://www.bi.team/\" target=\"_blank\">Behavioral Insights Team</a> prior to the development of the EAST framework. These behavioral influences are captured in the acronym MINDSPACE:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Messenger</strong>: Depending on who delivers the information, we may be more—or less—likely to act upon it. We are influenced by factors like how much we like and trust the messenger, how much of an authority we believe them to be, how official the communication is, how similar the messenger is to us, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Incentives</strong>: Financial incentives have been widely used by governments to motivate people to take action. This framework also considers non-financial incentives and proposes different ways to frame them, taking into account different biases such as loss aversion, anchoring, mental accounting, and hyperbolic discounting. Five psychological facts impact the effectiveness of incentives:\n<ol>\n<li>“Losses loom larger than gains.”</li>\n<li>“Reference points matter.” (For instance, if we expect to get money, then not getting it may be considered a “loss”; whereas if we <em>didn’t</em> expect to get it, then not getting it may be considered neutral.)</li>\n<li>“We overweight small probabilities.”</li>\n<li>“We mentally allocate money to discrete bundles.” (For example, if people view money they have received as a “rebate” versus “extra income,” they may act differently with that money.)</li>\n<li>“We live for today at the expense of tomorrow.”</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Norm</strong>: We tend to conform to social norms or copy what those around us do. Thus, if a certain behavior is presented as common, socially acceptable, or typical, it is more likely that we will adopt it. The downside is that if we accidentally signal that bad behavior is normal or common, we may accidentally increase the behavior we are trying to reduce. Five lessons about norms that can be leveraged are:\n<ol>\n<li>“If the norm is desirable, let people know about it.”</li>\n<li>“Relate the norm to your target audience as much as possible.” (In other words, make it clear that it is about people just like them.)</li>\n<li>“Consider social networks.” (This should be done because norms and information pass from person to person.)</li>\n<li>“Norms may need reinforcing.” (In other words, you may need to remind people of the norm multiple times so that effects don’t fade.)</li>\n<li>“Be careful when dealing with undesirable norms.”</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Defaults</strong>: People often choose to go with the preset option either because it is the easiest action to take, they don’t want to make a choice, or they assume it is the default for a good reason. Hence, it is important not to let the default be set at random; instead, take time to consider what the most beneficial default configuration should be.</li>\n<li><strong>Salience</strong>: We are surrounded by constant stimuli. Our minds subconsciously filter out the less relevant information, and make us aware only of what is particularly noticeable. Novelty, surprise, accessibility, contrast, and simplicity are characteristics that make something more salient. “Anchors”, which suggest a value, amount, or price, may make a particular number more salient. Salient occurrences in the past are more likely to be recalled from memory when we’re making decisions.</li>\n<li><strong>Priming</strong>: People’s behavior may in some contexts be impacted by subconscious cues, such as the display of walking shoes and running magazines to prime thoughts or actions related to a healthy lifestyle.</li>\n<li><strong>Affect</strong>: Emotional responses and moods greatly influence judgements and decision-making. For instance, “People in good moods make unrealistically optimistic judgements, whilst those in bad moods make unrealistically pessimistic judgements.” And in some cases, our actions are more driven by how we <em>feel</em> about a thing than what we <em>think</em> about the thing. Evoking emotion can be a powerfully motivating tool for change, but on the other hand, it should be done with care to avoid creating unnecessary negative emotions.</li>\n<li><strong>Commitment</strong>: When we make a commitment, we try to stick to it. Different types of commitment include written contracts, letting other people know about our intentions, and imposing penalties on ourselves. We “seek to be consistent with our public promises,” and we feel the need to reciprocate others’ prosocial behaviors with prosocial behavior of our own.</li>\n<li><strong>Ego</strong>: People have a desire to maintain a positive and consistent self-image, and behavior often reflects that desire. We also tend to want our behaviors and beliefs to be consistent with each other, and our future actions to be consistent with our past actions, which can lead to strategies for behavior change (e.g., getting a person to take one small action in a particular direction can facilitate further actions in that same direction). Additionally, we tend to compare ourselves against those around us, which can influence how we feel about our actions and ourselves.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Connection</strong>: When using the Ten Conditions for Change, you first identify which conditions are not being met, and then choose the most appropriate strategies to design a behavior change intervention. MINDSPACE provides categories of useful behavior change strategies that could be applied when using the Ten Conditions for Change framework. For example, if the desired behavior is that children should eat more fruit at the school cafeteria, and our framework diagnoses that the Chooses condition is not being met, then a possible intervention is to offer fruit bowls in which the fruit is already cut up and presented in an appealing way at the beginning of the food line (which is an intervention that attempts to increase Salience).</p>\n","id":"ll38wx9z961euhmf6l9lgc5hnvbtgagh"},{"title":"COM-B and the Behavior Change Wheel (2011)","year":2011,"content":"<p>The <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3096582/\" target=\"_blank\">COM-B system</a> (and the related “Behavior Change Wheel”) were released by <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/antimicrobial-resistance/people/susan-michie\" target=\"_blank\">Susan Michie</a>, <a href=\"https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/maartje-van-stralen\" target=\"_blank\">Maartje van Stralen</a>, and Robert West in 2011. It is a behavior change framework designed to be comprehensive (with the goal of being applicable to every intervention that “has been or could be developed”), coherent (“in that its categories are all exemplars of the same type of entity and have a broadly similar level of specificity”), and to have a clear link to an overarching model of behavior (in this case, based on “three factors that were necessary and sufficient prerequisites for the performance of a specified volitional behaviour”, derived from “a US consensus meeting of behavioural theorists in 1991, and a principle of US criminal law dating back many centuries”). The COM-B system was “developed from 19 frameworks of behavior change identified in a systematic literature review.”</p>\n<p>In the COM-B system, there are nine basic categories of interventions that can be deployed to try to influence behavior:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Education</strong>: “Increasing knowledge or understanding.”\n<ul>\n<li>e.g., “Providing information to promote healthy eating.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Persuasion</strong>: “Using communication to induce positive or negative feelings or stimulate action.”\n<ul>\n<li>e.g., “Using imagery to motivate increases in physical activity.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Incentivization</strong>: “Creating expectations of reward.”\n<ul>\n<li>e.g., “Using prize draws to induce attempts to stop smoking.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Coercion</strong>: “Creating expectations of punishment or cost.”\n<ul>\n<li>e.g., “Raising the financial cost to reduce excessive alcohol consumption.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Training</strong>: “Imparting skills.”\n<ul>\n<li>e.g., “Advanced driver training to increase safe driving.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Restriction</strong>: “Using rules to reduce the opportunity to engage in the target behavior (or to increase the target behavior by reducing the opportunity to engage in competing behaviors)”\n<ul>\n<li>e.g., “Prohibiting sales of solvents to people under 18 to reduce use for intoxication.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Environmental Restructuring</strong>: “Changing the physical or social context.”\n<ul>\n<li>e.g., “Providing on-screen prompts for GPs to ask about smoking behavior.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Modeling</strong>: “Providing an example for people to aspire to or imitate.”\n<ul>\n<li>e.g., “Using TV drama scenes involving safe-sex practices to increase condom use.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Enablement</strong>: “Increasing means / reducing barriers to increase capability [beyond education and training] or opportunity [beyond environmental restructuring].”\n<ul>\n<li>e.g., “Behavioural support for smoking cessation, medication for cognitive deficits, surgery to reduce obesity, prostheses to promote physical activity.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In the COM-B system (which stands for &quot;Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, and Behavior”), there are three necessary and sufficient prerequisites for the performance of a specified volitional behavior, and each of these prerequisites can be subdivided into two parts, forming six different characteristics that can be targeted by interventions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Capability</strong> (“the individual’s psychological and physical capacity to engage in the activity concerned”), subdivided into <em>Physical Capability</em> (the physical characteristics needed to carry out a behavior) and <em>Psychological Capability</em> (“the capacity to engage in the necessary thought processes—comprehension, reasoning, etc.”). To influence Capability, one can use interventions related to Education, Training, and Enablement.</li>\n<li><strong>Opportunity</strong> (“all the factors that lie outside the individual that make the behavior possible or prompt it”), subdivided into <em>Physical Opportunity</em> (“physical opportunity afforded by the environment”) and <em>Social Opportunity</em> (“social opportunity afforded by the cultural milieu that dictates the way that we think about things, e.g., the words and concepts that make up our language”). To influence Opportunity, one can use interventions related to Restriction, Environmental Restructuring, and Enablement.</li>\n<li><strong>Motivation</strong> (“those brain processes that energize and direct behavior, not just goals and conscious decision-making”), subdivided into <em>Automatic Motivation</em> (“involving emotions and impulses that arise from associative learning and/or innate dispositions”) and <em>Reflective Motivation</em> (“involving evaluations and plans”). To influence Automatic Motivation, one can use interventions related to Persuasion, Incentivisation, Coercion, Environmental Restructuring, Modeling, or Enablement. To influence Reflective Motivation, one can use interventions related to Education, Persuasion, Incentivisation, or Coercion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, in the COM-B system, there are seven different categories of policies, which are defined as “actions on the part of responsible authorities that enable or support interventions.” These are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Communication / marketing</strong> (“Using print, electronic, telephonic or broadcast media.”)\n<ul>\n<li>e.g., “Conducting mass media campaigns.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Guidelines</strong> (“Creating documents that recommend or mandate practice. This includes all changes to service provision.”)\n<ul>\n<li>e.g., “Producing and disseminating treatment protocols.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Fiscal</strong> (“Using the tax system to reduce or increase the financial cost.”)\n<ul>\n<li>e.g., “Increasing duty or increasing anti-smuggling activities.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Regulation</strong> (“Establishing rules or principles of behavior or practice.”)\n<ul>\n<li>e.g., “Establishing voluntary agreements on advertising.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Legislation</strong> (“Making or changing laws.”)\n<ul>\n<li>e.g., “Prohibiting sale or use.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Environmental / social planning</strong> (“Designing and/or controlling the physical or social environment.”)\n<ul>\n<li>e.g., “Using town planning.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Service provision</strong> (“Delivering a service.”)\n<ul>\n<li>e.g., “Establishing support services in workplaces, communities, etc.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Behavior Change Wheel (BCW) is a way of presenting the COM-B framework as a wheel consisting of different layers. The BCW “provides a systematic way of identifying relevant intervention functions and policy categories based on what is understood about the target behavior.” You can learn more about the Behavior Change Wheel <a href=\"http://www.behaviourchangewheel.com/about-wheel\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. As it explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The [inner] hub [of the wheel] identifies the sources of the behavior that could prove fruitful targets for intervention. It uses the COM-B (‘capability’, ‘opportunity’, ‘motivation’ and ‘behaviour’) model. This model recognizes that behavior is part of an interacting system involving all these components. Interventions need to change one or more of them in such a way as to put the system into a new configuration and minimize the risk of it reverting. Surrounding the hub is a layer of nine intervention functions to choose from based on the particular COM-B analysis one has undertaken. The outer layer, the rim of the wheel, identifies seven policy categories that can support the delivery of these intervention functions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Connection</strong>: The COM-B system’s three necessary and sufficient factors for the performance of a behavior—Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation—reflect a (less detailed) way of categorizing a number of the conditions found in the Ten Conditions framework. The Capability factor is closely related to our Embodies condition (and perhaps our Knows condition as well). The Motivation factor is essentially the same as our Desires condition. Finally, the Opportunity factor (which incorporates “all the factors that lie outside the individual that make the behavior possible or prompt it”) could, depending on one’s interpretation of the Opportunity factor, encompass our Has condition, and possibly elements of our Considers, Desires, Intends, Remembers, and Believes conditions.</p>\n","id":"96efojvmswpizfudnm95bszq7i0xynry"},{"title":"EAST (2012)","year":2012,"content":"<p>The <a href=\"https://www.behaviouralinsights.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BIT-Publication-EAST_FA_WEB.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">EAST</a> framework from the <a href=\"https://www.bi.team/\" target=\"_blank\">Behavioral Insights Team</a> provides four simple, useful ways to apply behavioral insights that can be relatively easily adopted in government and public policy.</p>\n<p>This framework advocates that you:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Define the outcome you are trying to impact</li>\n<li>Understand the context (from the perspective of those whose behaviors you are seeking to change)</li>\n<li>Build the intervention iteratively using the EAST factors (listed below)</li>\n<li>Test (to measure the effectiveness of the result), learn, and adapt</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To apply EAST, you should design your intended behaviors to be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>E</strong>asy (e.g., by applying defaults, reducing hassle, and simplifying messages)</li>\n<li><strong>A</strong>ttractive (e.g., by attracting attention and providing incentives)</li>\n<li><strong>S</strong>ocial (e.g., by showing that most people engage in the behavior, by leveraging existing person-to-person networks, and by encouraging people to make social commitments to others)</li>\n<li><strong>T</strong>imely (e.g., by prompting people at the times they are most likely to be receptive, by adjusting immediate costs and benefits of action for those the intervention is reaching, and by getting people to identify barriers to action and plan a solution)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Connection</strong>: The EAST framework is related to the Ten Conditions for Change framework in that EAST can provide a variety of helpful strategies for influencing a number of our ten conditions.</p>\n","id":"0iozsutrwt9fwnjs07gjapswze72jq8a"},{"title":"Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy (2013)","year":2013,"content":"<p>The <a href=\"http://openaccess.city.ac.uk/3293/1/Michie%20et%20al%20Annals%20of%20Behavioral%20Medicine%202013%20-%20BCT%20Taxonomy%20v1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Behavior Change Technique (BCT) Taxonomy</a>, created by Susan Michie, Michelle Richardson, Marie Johnston et al., provides a hierarchical clustering of 93 behavior change techniques (based on expert ratings of behavior change techniques from six previously published classification systems).

The “Hook” is a loop made up of four parts. The greater number of passes a user does through the Hook, the more likely it is they will return to the product. The parts are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Trigger</strong>: Something the user sees, feels, or thinks that leads them to interact with the product. Triggers can be external (notification emails, advertisements, a friend’s recommendation) or internal—when the product becomes tightly coupled with a thought, emotion, or pre-existing routine (e.g., reading the news while having breakfast or checking Facebook when bored).</li>\n<li><strong>Action</strong>: The minimum interaction the user needs to have with the product in anticipation of a reward. The framework relates to the Fogg Behavior Model where two factors determine the likelihood of adopting a behavior (which is, in the Hook model, performing the action): ability and motivation. The harder the action is, the more motivation the user will need. The framework stresses the importance of simplifying the action according to B.J. Fogg’s “Six Elements of Simplicity.”</li>\n<li><strong>Rewards</strong>: The reason why the user interacts with the product. The model emphasizes the effectiveness of variable rewards (where the reward size, or whether a reward is there at all, varies each time) because they create stickier behavior change. Examples of rewards are finding a stunning picture on Pinterest or getting “Likes” on Facebook. Three types of rewards are identified. Rewards that are a combination of all three are the most powerful ones and often found in the most popular products. These three reward types are:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rewards of the Tribe</strong> (social rewards)</li>\n<li><strong>Rewards of the Hunt</strong> (novelty)</li>\n<li><strong>Rewards of the Self</strong> (personal gratification)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Investment</strong>: Research shows that when people put effort into something, their commitment increases (e.g., because that effort makes the thing more valuable, or increases the psychological cost of stopping). In this phase, the user is asked to give some combination of time, data, effort, social capital, or money that will help “ensure that the user will make another pass through the Hook when presented with the next trigger.” Examples of investment are personalization of a site or uploading data to it (e.g., adding friends on Facebook or tracking sports sessions in an app to measure progress). Investment is more powerful when it leads to better rewards in the next loop: if you enter your personal interests on a news site, next time you access it you will be rewarded with more relevant content.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Connection</strong>: The external triggers of the Hook relate to the Considers, Intends, and Remembers conditions of the Ten Conditions for Change framework, whereas the internal triggers are more related to the Desires condition. The two relevant factors of the Action phase are ability and motivation, just like in the Fogg Behavior Model. Therefore, Action is linked to our framework’s Desires, Believes, and Chooses conditions (involving motivation), and Knows, Has, and Embodies (involving ability). Rewards help meet the Desires, Chooses, and Maintains conditions in our framework.

It has been used by a number of companies in the design of their products. It focuses on:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Identifying key <strong>behaviors</strong>, which are specific and measurable actions you want the user to take. Ask “Is this the single most important behavior for them to do?” and “How often do you want the user to do this behavior?”</li>\n<li>Reducing <strong>barriers</strong>, as they keep the users from doing the key behaviors. In this framework, “[every] click, every field, every signature, every step, every call, adds friction…Having to think and/or make a decision is also a barrier.” But also: “There are times where we want to have barriers. Adding friction can keep people from doing undesirable behaviors.”</li>\n<li>Amplifying <strong>benefits</strong> and creating new ones, which add motivation to perform the key behaviors. Ask “What would impact a user’s life right now?” and “Does the benefit appeal to emotion?” The framework also suggests that to “amplify existing benefits we can use our behavioral tools like social proof and loss aversion,” and that to “create new benefits we want to think about the product’s longer term benefits that we can make more immediately salient.”</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Connection</strong>: The key <em>behaviors</em> in this model may correspond with the different ACTIONs that comprise a single complex behavior in the Ten Conditions for Change framework. In our framework, evaluating the conditions for success in the DECISION, ACTION, and CONTINUATION phases is related to considering (from the Three B’s Approach perspective) how to reduce the <em>barriers</em> and amplify <em>benefits</em> of the behavior. <em>Barriers</em> take many different forms, like additional steps when logging into a site, instructions that are difficult to understand or unappealing, distractions, and lack of knowledge. Strategies that aim to reduce <em>barriers</em> standing in the way of behavior adoption can help meet the Remembers, Chooses, Knows, and Has conditions. Strategies that aim to increase the <em>benefits</em> of behavior adoption—from immediate rewards to behavioral tools like social proof and loss aversion—can help meet the Desires, Believes, and Maintains conditions.</p>\n","id":"ja0cwkltujp5qikawaeybxxgst2a0wey"},{"title":"Wise Interventions (2018)","year":2018,"content":"<p>The <a href=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/59de5a0cc164e3000177d2a1/5bd27f16eb34b0708083051b_waltonwilson2018.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Wise Interventions</a> approach by <a href=\"http://gregorywalton-stanford.weebly.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gregory M.

For example: “Entrepreneurs register for business courses, but do not attend the first class. The behavior is specific (people sign up, but don’t attend); the population is specific (entrepreneurs who register for the class), and there’s no presumption about why they are not attending, nor about what an appropriate solution would be.”</li>\n<li><strong>Diagnose</strong>: Generate hypotheses about the bottlenecks that keep people in the target population from adopting the relevant behaviors by using quantitative and qualitative methods. For instance, this can be done using the proprietary technique the authors call “behavioral mapping,” which is designed to “pinpoint discrete decision and action points in a process. For each of these points, [they then] use insights from behavioral science to identify psychological factors and contextual features that might affect choice and action.”</li>\n<li><strong>Design</strong>: Create interventions that address the previously diagnosed bottlenecks. Pragmatic factors will need to be taken into account during the design phase, such as “your timeline, available resources, and the potential for the intervention to scale.” It is important to build prototypes of the interventions and user-test them to see how the population interacts with them and to potentially uncover new bottlenecks. As new information is learned about the end user, you may have to return temporarily to the <em>Diagnose</em> phase.</li>\n<li><strong>Test</strong>: Determine the extent to which the interventions worked to help solve the problem that was identified during the <em>Define</em> phase. When feasible, it is recommended to use randomized control trials (RCTs) to evaluate the impact of the interventions.</li>\n<li><strong>Scale</strong>: Expand the scope of successful interventions by applying them to larger populations or in new contexts. However, rather than rushing into full scale prematurely, it is often wise to replicate the <em>Test</em> phase at a larger scale or in whatever new context you may want to apply it, in addition to looking for opportunities to further improve the interventions. It is also important to use “Cost-effectiveness analyses, [which] can help estimate upfront and continuing costs so that agencies can make informed decisions on how and where they want to scale.”</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Connection</strong>: The Behavioral Design Process has been designed for a specific (yet powerful) application of behavioral science, which is to help improve public programs and policies, though it surely can be adapted to other domains as well. Like Intervention Mapping, it is a process that runs from the identification of the problem through the implementation of the interventions. During the <em>Diagnose</em> stage of the project, the Behavioral Design Team must understand why the population is not exhibiting the desired behavior, and the Ten Conditions for Change framework may be a useful diagnostic tool to help identify behavioral bottlenecks. And during the <em>Design</em> phase, the Ten Conditions for Change framework can be used to identify potential interventions that could be applied to help create the behavior.</p>\n","id":"nm0ql3bmc3qnhif5yerwrygfklro8ook"},{"title":"Intervention Design Process (2019)","year":2019,"content":"<p>The Intervention Design Process (IDP) was invented by <a href=\"https://mattwallaert.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Matt Wallaert</a> and is explained in his book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07L2HM12P/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=shopprime3-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07L2HM12P&amp;linkId=d7dcf93b91bd6de4e98a463c98d32ea3\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Start at the End: How to Build Products That Create Change</em></a>. The book contains far more information than the simplified summary below, so it is necessary to read the book to understand the framework completely.</p>\n<p>Wallaert summarizes the IDP framework in this way:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When we want to change behavior, we start with a potential insight—an observation about the distance between our current world and the counterfactual one in which we want to live. We then validate the insight and flesh it out into a behavioral statement, which we use to map the pressures that are creating the current state of the behavior and thus are the levers we push to change it. After we’ve validated the pressures, we design interventions that modify them, select and do an ethical check of the ones we choose to pilot (and validate), test (and validate), and (if those work), make a scale decision, with continuous monitoring to make sure the interventions continue to contribute to the behavior we want.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To apply the IDP framework, use the following steps.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1. Generate and validate insights.</strong></p>\n<p>“When we want to change behavior, we start with a potential insight—an observation about the distance between our current world and the counterfactual one in which we want to live.”</p>\n<p>Wallaert describes four types of insights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Quantitative insights</em>, which are driven by data, either by uncovering patterns in the data, or studying the positive or negative outliers</li>\n<li><em>Qualitative insights</em>, which come from talking to and observing people in the world, such as via interviews with customers and relevant non-customers</li>\n<li><em>Apocryphal insights</em>, which are common knowledge within your organization, which may or may not turn out to be true, and which it is therefore important to validate</li>\n<li><em>External insights</em>, which come from knowledge in the world outside of your organization, such as from academic papers, experts in other industries, professors, or grad students, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To validate an insight, look for convergence across multiple types of insight (e.g., the quantitative and qualitative conclusions agree with each other).</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2. Generate a behavioral statement from those insights that describes the world you are trying to create from a behavioral perspective.</strong></p>\n<p>As Wallaert explains it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Behavioral statements are] an articulation of the world we are trying to create, written from an explicitly behavioral perspective. This description of the counterfactual world, which we realize exists through our insights and insight validation, lays the foundation for…pressure mapping and eventually intervention design…At its core, a behavioral statement is simply a set of binary conditions that can either be satisfied or not. A typical behavioral statement has five variables that come together into a single sentence:</p>\n<p>When [population] wants to [motivation], and they [limitations], they will [behavior] (as measured by [data]).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Population = the group of people whose behavior you are trying to change</li>\n<li>Motivation = the core motive for why people engage in the behavior</li>\n<li>Limitations = the binary preconditions necessary for the behavior to happen that are outside of your control (it is essential that in the limitations you don’t include factors that you plan to try to influence)</li>\n<li>Behavior = the measurable activity you want people always to do when they have the motivation and limitations above</li>\n<li>Data = how you quantify that they are doing the behavior&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Wallaert gives the example of the Uber car ride service:</p>\n<p>“When [people] want to [get from point A to point B], and they [have a smartphone with connectivity and an electronic form of payment], they will [take an Uber] (as measured by [number of rides]).”</p>\n<p>He cautions:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Writing a good behavioral statement is [one of the hardest parts] of the IDP…Easily the most common mistake is not being thoughtful enough about the actual behavior you want to change. This often comes because you’re focusing on sounding good instead of being good, trying to write a vision statement instead of a behavioral one…[however,] potentially worse than picking the wrong behavior is picking no behavior at all, and that’s the second-most-common mistake.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How can you make your behavioral statement valuable to your organization? Wallaert says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Put it on the wall where everyone can see it…while you should have only one behavioral statement for your organization as a whole, you can scale them endlessly down as needed…Ultimately, the organization’s behavioral statement is the thing the CEO is held accountable for: moving (or not moving) that behavior should be the metric by which we reward and punish that single person at the top. But by writing smaller behavioral statements throughout your organization, you can help everyone find the zone within which they have autonomy and thus accountability.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Step 3. Map pressures that promote and inhibit the behavior.</strong></p>\n<p>In this step, you or your organization needs to make a list of the relevant promoting pressures and inhibiting pressures that influence the behavior.</p>\n<p>As Wallaert puts it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We need to map the pressures that create the distance between what we have and what we want, so we know what it is we need to change…when we talk about designing for behavior change, we are actually talking about changing the pressures that determine the behavior, rather than directly changing the behavior itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Promoting pressures</em> make a behavior more likely. For instance, an action being pleasurable, easy, exciting, appealing, close by, etc., encourages people to take the action.</p>\n<p><em>Inhibiting pressures</em> make a behavior less likely. For instance, an action being confusing, expensive, time-consuming, boring, etc., discourages people from taking the action.</p>\n<p>As Wallaert says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What we actually do is determined by the net product of those forces. If the promoting pressures overcome the inhibiting pressures, we act. If the inhibiting pressures are stronger, we don’t…[but] where do all the pressures come from? [In the] IDP we generate them in the same way we generate insights: research and convergent validity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Step 4. Validate the pressures and choose which ones to target.</strong></p>\n<p>Ideally, you would confirm that the forces you believe are inhibiting pressures actually are reducing the behavior and that the forces you believe are promoting pressures actually are increasing the behavior.</p>\n<p>“Fortunately, all of the interviews and data science you did in search of insights also naturally lend themselves to the mapping and validating of pressures…Like insights, pressures need to be validated.”</p>\n<p>Once validated, you’ll have an idea of which pressures to target with interventions.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 5. Design multiple interventions that target the identified pressures.</strong></p>\n<p>The interventions you design are the specific changes you will make to your product, to your marketing, or to the world that will attempt to alter the relevant pressures.</p>\n<p>Wallaert says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is entirely possible for a single pressure to give rise to many interventions and equally possible for one intervention to satisfy many pressures. Indeed, that’s very much the point of mapping: by formalizing our understanding of pressures, we can more easily see how to combine them and sort them. Intervention design is really just the translation of pressures into something we can actually create; if pressures are the levers, interventions are how we pull them, hopefully in the right order and with the right strength.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Step 6. Do an ethics check to make sure the interventions are ethical.</strong></p>\n<p>According to the framework, a behavior change intervention is unethical if ANY of the following is true:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lack of motivation—your outcome behavior is not the result of any of the motivations of the population. For instance, if your outcome behavior is that your population spends more time on their phone, but your user base wants to spend less time on their phone, this is an ethical problem.</li>\n<li>Lack of sufficient benefits—the benefit of your outcome behavior (or an intervention to produce it) does not outweigh the cost [it incurs on] an alternative motivation (for the target population). For instance, if your user base does have the motivation to eat tasty food, but the tasty food you give them is very unhealthy, and the health harms (according to the customer) are greater in magnitude than the enjoyment from eating the tasty food, this is an ethical problem.</li>\n<li>Lack of willingness for transparency—you are unwilling to publicly describe and take responsibility for the outcome behavior or intervention. If you would be embarrassed to publicize the method you are using or the behavioral outcome you are trying to create for your users, this is an ethical problem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Step 7. Select interventions to pilot.</strong></p>\n<p>The most subjective part of the entire IDP is intervention selection.</p>\n<p>As Wallaert explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Because ultimately, even with all the insights and pressures and research, you have to make a judgment call about which interventions you’re actually going to pilot (because logistically you can’t pilot everything)…But you can make smart bets. Because although you can’t pilot everything, you also shouldn’t pilot only one thing. Intervention selection isn’t about driving to a single solution but rather about setting yourself up for a range of pilots that maximize the chance of creating behavior change. Because good behavioral science, like all good science, is based on the assumption that your intervention won’t work…In selecting multiple interventions, you’re shooting for something psychologists call optimum distinctiveness: a range of options that together cover as much of the spectrum as possible, but with relatively little overlap.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>To reduce your option set, you can do a few things to make it easier. First, combine interventions…Remember, the goal is behavior change, not knowledge—we don’t have to know precisely which part of an intervention drives the behavior, so long as the overall intervention is scalable and results in worthwhile behavior change.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>If you’ve done your job while writing your behavioral statement and defined the right population, then intervention selection is about identifying the cheapest, easiest-to-create, most broadly reaching intervention that still changes the behavior.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Step 8. Pilot interventions.</strong></p>\n<p>Wallaert says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Pilots are] tightly scoped interventions that we expect not to work…so we use small populations, focus on speed to market, and do them in an operationally dirty way [that has minimum impact on the organization as a whole in the event of failure]…Speed and resource efficiency are also important here. Because we chose multiple interventions during intervention selection, we’ll likely be running three to five concurrent pilots at any given time…[a rule of thumb] for project managers is that if it takes longer than two weeks to get into the field, you need to scale it back and go smaller.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>Pilot validation is just like insight validation: qualitative and quantitative confirmation that you’re headed in the right direction. Because of the small [sample size], it won’t be statistically significant [i.e., you may find p=0.20 instead of p=0.04, and that may be sufficient evidence to proceed to the next step]; you’re just trying to get enough of a positive/negative/null signal to make a decision about what comes next…Quantitative researchers will figure out how to actually get that data [to measure the behavior] in a durable way, and qualitative researchers start to understand what questions to ask in their interview script and what environments are the right ones for observation. Done right, the instrumentation we build now will carry us through until we make a scaling decision…We care about changing behavior, not the gnostic pursuit of knowledge…For the interventions typically on the table, there are generally few consequences to being wrong other than wasted resources. So it isn’t such a terrible thing to be right [only] four out of five times if the intervention has no significant downsides.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>When an intervention doesn’t create the behavior change you want, you’ve got a decision to make…either you revise the pilot and rerun, or you kill it and return to your pressure map and intervention design.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Step 9. Test pilots that show promise.</strong></p>\n<p>After piloting, those interventions that appear promising will then be tested at a larger size. Those interventions that succeed in testing will then be considered as candidates for scaling.</p>\n<p>Wallaert says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A test is just like a pilot, but with a larger population and greater operational diligence. We’re looking hard at the question of ‘is it worth it?’ In this step, measuring how hard it is going to be to scale against the overall impact it will actually have on behavior. [This] kills more things that you’d think: it turns out to be relatively easy to find interventions that change behavior but relatively hard to find ones that are worth doing. And the way we know is through test validation; again, that constant quantitative and qualitative feedback is key, though our tests also have to stand up to our requirements about operational cost and [intervention] effect size.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Step 10. Develop a “juice / squeeze” statement for those interventions that seem promising after testing, and evaluate which interventions are worth scaling given the effort required.</strong></p>\n<p>As Wallaert explains, piloting and testing culminate in a “juice / squeeze” statement, which summarizes the finding in the following format:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We are [confidence] that [intervention] will [direction] [behavior] (as measured by [data]). Scaling this requires [effort] and will result in [change].</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Confidence = based on p-value but phrased colloquially</li>\n<li>Intervention = what the intervention is</li>\n<li>Direction = whether it increases or decreases the behavior</li>\n<li>Behavior = the measurable activity you established in your behavior statement</li>\n<li>Data = how you quantify that your population is doing the behavior</li>\n<li>Effort = the resources required to scale</li>\n<li>Change = based on effect size but phrased colloquially</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>An example from Wallaert: “We are [very confident] that [sending personalized flu shot letters based on member health motivations] will [increase] [the rate of getting flu shots] (as measured by [flu shot claims]). Scaling this requires [about ten hours and $5,500] and will result in [about 500 additional flu shots].”</p>\n<p>Such a statement will be used to make a decision of whether or not to scale up the intervention.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 11. Scale the interventions that appear to be worth scaling.</strong></p>\n<p>Using the juice / squeeze statements, decide which interventions are worth the investment to scale, keeping in mind that most interventions probably won’t be worth the effort they would entail.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 12. Use continuous monitoring to make sure that interventions continue to work.</strong></p>\n<p>As Wallaert says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even scaled interventions eventually stop working. And the only way to know when they do, and to modify or eliminate them, is to implement continuous monitoring. It is validation all over again, but in an ongoing way that checks the health not just of one of the interventions, but of our entire behavior-change portfolio.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>Changing pressures may cause you to modify or terminate any number of interventions, and that’s just a natural part of the process…[since we document] the entire IDP that produced them, we can work back up the chain to see what has shifted…make sure your continuous monitoring has interruptive alerts. A dashboard is not continuous monitoring, because it requires a human to open said dashboard and monitor for change.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For more many more details about how to apply this process, read Wallaert’s book <em>Start at the End: How to Build Products That Create Change</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Connection</strong>: The IDP’s third step—mapping the pressures that promote and inhibit the behavior—relates to the overall goal of our Ten Conditions framework, which is to understand the sort of factors that affect behavior. In other words, mapping the various pressures that encourage or discourage a behavior involves understanding the conditions under which people engage in the behavior. The IDP’s fifth and seventh steps—designing and selecting interventions to target the pressures—occur in our framework as well: after identifying conditions that need improvement, interventions are designed and selected to target those conditions.</p>\n","id":"qqklb5mc2x7xpztopqscha5teiu60rhi"}]}}
