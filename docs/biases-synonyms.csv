"""After This, Therefore Because of This"" Fallacy (Post Hoc, Ergo Propter Hoc)",Desires,"This fallacy occurs when a person assumes that event A caused event B because B occurred after A.

Generation Effect in Memory,Intends,"The Generation Effect refers to the finding that information will be better remembered if it is generated rather than simply read. To leverage this bias, encourage people come to conclusions for themselves instead of handing them a fully-formed train of thought. For example, encourage someone to start giving to charity by asking them questions that challenge them to think about their values and about ways in which they are or aren't acting in accordance with those values. Also, ask people to develop mnemonic devices or other kinds of memory triggers to remember to perform the relevant actions. For example, if someone is trying to manage their anger, they could come up with the acronym ""CAT,"" which stands for ""Controlling Anger Today,"" and ask them to post the acronym somewhere they'll see it often or to repeat it often as a kind of mantra.",remembered refers generated generation finding effect simply rather information read,"['dwell', 'erase', 'forget', 'generate', 'memories', 'memory', 'remember', 'remembering', 'rewind', 'underestimate']"
Actor-Observer Asymmetry,Intends,"The Actor-Observer Asymmetry occurs when people subconsciously change the way they attribute behavior to various factors depending on whether they're the person performing the behavior (the *actor*) or a witness to the behavior from the outside (an *observer*). When assessing their own behavior as actors, people tend to emphasize the influence of the situation on their behavior and downplay the influence of their own personality or character. When assessing others' behavior as observers, the reverse is true: people's assessment of others' behavior tends to emphasize the influence of personality or character in the behavior and downplay the influence of the situation. To overcome this bias, ask people to consider how a friend, loved one, or ideal person would've behaved in the same situation. For example, if a person skipped gym day because it was raining really hard that day, ask them whether or not their gym buddy also skipped that day because of the rain. By comparing their actions against other people in identical situations, they can see that the context was less relevant than they supposed and that their character was more relevant than they supposed.",downplay actors assessing others' emphasize actor assessment observers personality attribute,"['actor', 'agent', 'assassin', 'astronomer', 'asymmetry', 'fractals', 'luminosity', 'observer', 'philosopher', 'physicist', 'scholar', 'symmetry']"
Ad Hoc Rescue,Desires,"An Ad Hoc Rescue is an attempt to save a cherished belief by repeatedly revising the argument to explain away problems. To overcome this bias, show people facts. For example, if you'd like to encourage someone to start giving to charity but they keep coming up with new reasons why giving to charity is useless or bad (e.g., social darwinism is morally good, poor people are poor because they're bad managers of their resources, everyone should pull themselves up by their own bootstraps, nonprofit organizations only pass along a small percentage of donations to poor people, etc.), then you could show them statistics about how giving to charity pulls more people out of poverty than other solutions do. Of course, this assumes that they share the same values as you but believe other strategies are more effective. If they don't even share the same values, a more philosophical argument may be required. (Honestly, though, it may not be possible to overcome this bias; some people are committed to their beliefs regardless of evidence or argument, so your time may be better spent elsewhere.)",revising cherished hoc rescue repeatedly ad belief attempt save argument,"['backtrack', 'delete', 'edit', 'erase', 'goalpost', 'kimura', 'move', 'rescue', 'resize', 'retract', 'revise', 'rewind', 'rewrite', 'timeout']"
Ad Hominem Fallacy,Desires,"The Ad Hominem Fallacy occurs when a person attacks the arguer instead of the argument in order to draw the conclusion that the argument is false. To overcome this bias, ask people to replace the actual messenger with a trusted imaginary messenger (or merely omit the messenger altogether); then, ask them to reconsider the message. To leverage this bias, deliver the message using a messenger that you know the audience will trust.",arguer hominem fallacy attacks occurs conclusion ad draw false argument,"['attributes', 'character', 'characteristics', 'genes', 'instincts', 'intellect', 'person', 'personalities', 'personality', 'qualities', 'trait', 'traits']"
Affirmative Conclusion from a Negative Premise Fallacy,Desires,"This fallacy has the form: ""A is not a subset of B. B is not a subset of C. Therefore A is a subset of C."" It might be helpful to point out to people when this fallacy is affecting their reasoning, especially when it affects their perceptions about the rationale for or effects of a desired behavior (e.g., it would be particularly important to identify flawed reasoning if it is decreasing their desire to engage in a positive behavior, decreasing the degree to which they believe it will enable them to meet goals that are important to them, or decreasing the attractiveness of a behavior relative to alternative behaviors). For example, someone might reason that ""people who take smoking breaks at work"" are not a subset of ""people who never take any breaks at work"", and ""people who never take any breaks at work"" are not a subset of ""people who have a healthy work-life balance""; they may then reach the erroneous conclusion that ""people who take smoking breaks at work have a healthy work-life balance"". One way to correct them might be to point out this reasoning fallacy. (However, it might be simpler and/or easier to simply point out counterexamples showing them that their conclusion is inaccurate, such as examples of people who take smoking breaks but who have to consistently stay later at work [and have to cut down on evening social events], due to their smoking breaks interrupting their workflow.)",subset fallacy form therefore b c has not this is,"['affirmative', 'conclusion', 'conclusions', 'conclusive', 'constructive', 'empirical', 'hypothesis', 'inference', 'negative', 'positive', 'premise', 'subjective']"
Affirming a Disjunct Fallacy,Desires,"This fallacy has the form: ""A or B. A. Therefore not B."" The fallacy lies in concluding that one disjunct must be false because the other disjunct is true; in fact, they may both be true. (Of course, this depends on whether ""or"" is defined *inclusively* or *exclusively*. The fallacy can only occur when ""or"" is defined inclusively. If ""or"" is defined exclusively, then the above form is valid, and it would be fallacious to conclude that both disjuncts can be true at the same time. To avoid either mistake and to communicate clearly, be sure to include some form of ""both"" in the language, like: ""A or B, or both"" (inclusive) or ""A or B, but not both"" (exclusive), but not both.) It may help to point out to people when this fallacy is affecting their reasoning, especially when it affects their perceptions about the rationale for or effects of a desired behavior (e.g., it would be particularly important to identify flawed reasoning if it is decreasing their desire to engage in a positive behavior, decreasing the degree to which they believe it will enable them to meet goals that are important to them, or decreasing the attractiveness of a behavior relative to alternative behaviors). For example, someone might believe that either ""you stop smoking socially at parties"" OR ""you keep enjoying parties"", without realising that the two are not mutually exclusive categories, and it is actually possible to stop smoking socially at parties while still enjoying them. A benevolent helper could respectfully point out the fallacy inherent in affirming a disjunct in this case. This could be aided by providing some counterexamples (e.g., providing examples of people who don't smoke and still love parties). Another way in which this fallacy could negatively influence behavior change would be when people draw incorrect conclusions regarding the resources and other requirements for performing or for continuing a particular action: for example, they may believe that either ""you don't have a gym membership"" (A) OR ""you have the ability to meet your recommended levels of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise each week"" (B), without realising that A does not preclude B (i.e. if A applies, it doesn't mean that B can't apply). If they engage in this kind of reasoning, it may lead them to believe that they don't have the required resources to increase their physical activity levels. Respectfully pointing out that they are engaging in this kind of reasoning, and/or providing counterexamples (such as their ability to start jogging or cycling, at a much lower cost than starting a gym membership) may help in cases like these.",concluding inclusive fallacious exclusive exclusively communicate fallacy conclude lies mistake,"['affirm', 'affirmation', 'affirmed', 'disjunct', 'either', 'exclusive', 'inalienable', 'inclusive', 'or', 'pursuant', 'reaffirm', 'subscribe', 'unbiased', 'uphold']"
Affirming the Consequent Fallacy,Intends,"This fallacy has the form: ""If P, then Q. Q. Therefore P."" The mistake lies in the assumption that if P implies Q, then Q implies P. In cases where this fallacy is decreasing someone's desire or intention to engage in a positive behavior, and/or is decreasing their perception of how achievable it is, then it might help to point out this fallacy directly; this might be relatively simple if counterexamples come to mind. For example, if someone sees that their friends who have gym memberships are physically fit, they may assume that anyone who is physically fit must have a gym membership. If the person in question can't afford a gym membership or doesn't like the thought of using a gym during a pandemic, then it could be quite counterproductive for them to erroneously conclude that if they want to be fit, then they will need a gym membership (as this would give them the impression that increasing their level of physical fitness is an unattainable goal merely because they can't join a gym). This could be addressed by identifying counterexamples (e.g., drawing on examples of people who are physically fit who regularly engage in low-cost exercise outside of the gym).",fallacy implies assumption lies mistake q form therefore p then,"['after', 'ascribe', 'consequence', 'consequent', 'constitute', 'construed', 'denote', 'equate', 'if', 'implication', 'implies', 'imply', 'resultant', 'then']"
Ambiguity Effect,Desires,"The Ambiguity Effect is a cognitive bias where decision-making is affected by a lack of information or ""ambiguity."" The effect implies that people tend to select options for which the probability of a favorable outcome is known instead of an option for which the probability of a favorable outcome is unknown. To overcome this effect, report the likelihood of all outcomes and help people to develop an intuitive feel for the likelihoods by comparing them to commonly-known outcomes.",decision-making cognitive ambiguity favorable outcome bias probability implies affected unknown,"['ambiguity', 'ambiguous', 'clarification', 'clarity', 'confusion', 'information', 'specifics', 'subjective', 'uncertainty', 'unclear', 'vague']"
Anchoring Bias (see Focusing Effect),Desires,"The Anchoring Bias occurs when a person's expectation about one thing is affected by something they saw, heard, or thought before. In other words, it occurs when a person relies too heavily on a specific piece of information to govern their thought process. To overcome this bias, help them to understand that their past experiences may be out-of-date (e.g., if costs are much higher than they remembered them being) or based on incorrect information. To leverage this bias, suggest a specific number (e.g., dollar amount) as a starting point for giving, negotiating, etc.",govern expectation relies person's bias heavily affected occurs piece specific,"['anchor', 'concentrate', 'depend', 'depends', 'focus', 'focused', 'relied', 'relies', 'rely', 'relying', 'specific']"
Anecdotal Evidence Fallacy,Desires,"The Anecdotal Evidence Fallacy is the discounting of evidence arrived at by systematic search or testing in favor of a few firsthand stories. To overcome this fallacy, point out that anecdotes can never be generalized to a population but that a population contains within itself many anecdotes. In other words, a population represents many individuals, but a single individual does not necessarily represent the population (since it's possible to tell a true anecdote that's nevertheless statistically rare for a population). To leverage this bias, use anecdotes to describe what individual experiences may look like, but be sure to mention that the anecdotes are only part of the statistical story. In other words, ""your mileage may vary.""",discounting firsthand systematic anecdotal fallacy arrived favor testing stories search,"['anecdotal', 'anecdote', 'evidence', 'facts', 'proverb', 'statistic', 'statistics', 'stats', 'stories', 'story', 'tales']"
Appeal to Novelty Fallacy,Desires,"The Appeal to Novelty Fallacy is the belief that something is automatically better because it is new or newer. To overcome this fallacy, point out that there are significant (but often less noticeable) risks and costs associated with always having / using the newest thing. For example, trying to incorporate the latest trends in exercise requires continually learning new skills; and trying to eat in accordance with the latest diet trends puts one's health at risk since there may be little research into the long-term effects of the diet. Point out that old things may be less fashionable but are also more reliable, well-tested, and often cheaper. To leverage this fallacy, show that the target behavior can be adopted in a new way. For example, to convince people to stop smoking cigarettes (which is not a new idea), show them new techniques and tools for quitting, such as a new medication or a new kind of chewing gum.",novelty appeal fallacy newer automatically belief better something because new,"['customizable', 'customize', 'customized', 'distinct', 'distinctive', 'diverse', 'incorporates', 'innovative', 'new', 'original', 'unique']"
Appeal to Authority Fallacy,Considers,"The Appeal to Authority Fallacy is the argument that a statement is correct because the statement is made by a person or source that is commonly regarded as authoritative. To overcome this fallacy, disconnect the message from the messenger and analyze the message itself. For example, ""I know you've adopted Diet X because Dr. Oz recommended it, but is it really true that X is safe and effective? I think you should see what the research shows about X before adopting it."" To leverage this fallacy, ask trusted authority figures to deliver messages.

Appeal to Common Practice Fallacy,Desires,"The Appeal to Common Practice Fallacy is the claim that something is true because it's commonly practiced. To overcome this fallacy, show counterexamples where a common practice or belief was later shown to be false, dangerous, or immoral. (This by itself doesn't prove that a claim is false; it only demonstrates that the majority isn't always right and that common practice isn't proof of truth or moral acceptability.) For example, the consumption of meat is common in many — perhaps most — parts of the world, but its commonness doesn't alone make it morally justified.",practiced appeal fallacy commonly practice common claim true something because,"['common', 'everyone', 'majority', 'overwhelmingly', 'popular', 'popularity', 'subjective', 'supermajority', 'thirds', 'universally', 'widespread']"
Appeal to Consequences Fallacy,Considers,"The Appeal to Consequences Fallacy is an argument that concludes that a premise (typically a belief) is either true or false based on whether the premise leads to desirable or undesirable consequences. Pointing out this fallacy directly might have the potential to backfire, since this kind of reasoning can be associated with cognitive dissonance and motivated reasoning, which may decrease the degree to which people can engage rationally and productively with information and/or arguments contradicting their current thinking (e.g., [Rothgerber, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666319306324?casa_token=TbOa-8zyVboAAAAA:pwCeOrthXBA3hSOV8dSmUNyL5cIT4oeSJV3jYRNd5wCSseAtLw4rvD0cYYRU6VZRhBohasvyO7Y)). Motivated reasoning may become particularly problematic when the topic at hand is framed in moral terms (as topics framed in terms of morality can be associated with more polarization than those perceived through a pragmatic lens; [Abeywickrama et al., 2020](https://jspp.psychopen.eu/index.php/jspp/article/view/5263)). Having said that, given the right circumstances and the right person, it might sometimes be worth telling someone when it seems like this fallacy is affecting their reasoning (if the backfire risk is judged to be sufficiently low). It is especially important to approach this reasoning fallacy strategically in cases where it affects someone's perceptions about the rationale for, intention to engage in, and beliefs about the feasibility and consequences of a desired behavior. This may be worth taking into consideration when raising initial awareness of a behavior or its consequences: if the target audience has certain ideas that they hold strongly, and value highly, then it could backfire to convey information that directly challenges those beliefs. And when information _is_ presented that _could_ contradict someone's cherished beliefs, it might be preferable to share the information on its own - without sharing the conclusions or providing behavioral prescriptions - in order to encourage the person to come to their _own_ conclusions (which could also leverage the Generation Effect). Over the longer-term, it may help to encourage people to foster more epistemic humility, potentially through practicing dialogic argumentation in a wide variety of contexts ([Kuhn & Crowell, 2011](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797611402512?casa_token=j8n-fvNZXIcAAAAA%3ARQxwCnHBeC4V_rEOge0_-zqCBENDDml05g1n502cs7OTa8ADJ2pONhY88bhP2p3CHRm0C7RA6-lsww)). More research in this area is needed, but some evidence suggests that such approaches may enable people to become less attached to their desired conclusions ([Švaříček, 2019](https://www.phil.muni.cz/journals/index.php/studia-paedagogica/article/view/2063), which may increase their ability to form more realistic beliefs through the use of reasoning and evidence.",undesirable concludes desirable appeal fallacy premise consequences typically leads false,"['adverse', 'consequence', 'consequences', 'construed', 'desirable', 'detrimental', 'outcome', 'result', 'subjective', 'undesirable', 'undesired']"
Appeal to Fear Fallacy,Desires,"The Appeal to Fear Fallacy is the argument that one of two things must be true and that, because one of the things is frightening, the other must be true. It usually has the form: ""Either P or Q is true. Q is frightening. Therefore, P is true."" This fallacy could be leveraged by highlighting undesirable and/or risky outcomes that are expected if the person doesn't engage in the desired behavior change. It could also help to motivate people to maintain the behavior, in cases where they either fear failure itself, or fear the consequences of that failure. In other cases, it may prevent someone from engaging in a positive behavior, by reducing the range of possible behaviors a person considers possible, plans for, and enacts. The way in which this is addressed may depend on how severe the person's fear is, and how strongly they hold their current beliefs relating to the feared outcome(s). If the backfire risk is deemed to be low, then it might be helpful to encourage the person to acknowledge the fear, to analyze the reasons behind it (and the person's consequent fear/anxiety), and to manage it directly. On the other hand, if the person has strongly-held beliefs relating to the fear or its consequences, then it may be preferable to avoid confronting it directly, and to instead employ the strategies suggested for the broader, related category of the Appeal to Consequences fallacy.",frightening appeal fallacy fear q argument form therefore usually p,"['fear', 'fearful', 'frightened', 'frightening', 'nightmare', 'scared', 'scares', 'scary', 'terrified', 'terrifying']"
Appeal to Flattery Fallacy,Desires,"The Appeal to Flattery Fallacy is the use of an irrelevant compliment to slip in an unfounded claim which is accepted along with the compliment. It usually has the form: ""You have desireable property X, so of course you'll know that P is true."" It might be beneficial to use legitimate compliments as a way of motivating people to engage in (or continue engaging in) positive behaviors. As long as the flattery is actually warranted (i.e. not dishonest), then its use may motivate people to consider, plan for, willingly engage in and maintain positive behaviors, especially if they ascribe positive characteristics to themselves owing to them having engaged in the behavior. For example, the language training app DuoLingo employs flattery to motivate its users when they engage in streaks of practice days. On the other hand, if flattery is unwarranted or is flasely inflated, then as well as being dishonest/unethical, this would run the risk of backfiring via the Argument from Fallacy (if/when the person identifies the use of unwarranted flattery).",flattery compliment desireable unfounded slip appeal fallacy irrelevant property accepted,"['compliment', 'curves', 'deceive', 'emulate', 'flatter', 'insult', 'kinder', 'nicer', 'prettier', 'smoother', 'sporty', 'width']"
Appeal to Hypocrisy Fallacy,Desires,"The Appeal to Hypocrisy Fallacy is the argument that a position is wrong because the person arguing for it does not live in accordance with it. Ideally, only encourage others to engage in a positive behavior change if you have done so yourself. This might not always be possible, but the existence of this fallacy at least suggests that the ways in which information is delivered should be carefully planned: in cases where people are providing behavioral advice or tips, it may be advisable for the person explaining it to be selected on the basis of their own experience in engaging in the behavior in question, in order for that advice to be (at least perceived as) more credible.",accordance hypocrisy appeal fallacy arguing argument position live person wrong,"['accordance', 'arrogance', 'complies', 'conforms', 'congruence', 'consistency', 'disregard', 'humility', 'hypocrisy', 'irrationality', 'objectivity']"
Appeal to Incredulity Fallacy,Desires,"The Appeal to Incredulity Fallacy is the dismissal of a proposition as false because it sounds unbelievable. Encourage healthy skepticism, but share available evidence with people to help them to come to a conclusion about the veracity of the claim(s) they are doubting. Appeals to incredulity may discourage people from engaging in positive behaviors (e.g., due to skepticism regarding the positive impact of these behaviors, the simplicity (or complexity) of the required planning, the simplicity (or complexity) of the required actions, and/or the advantages offered by the behavior in question in comparison to other questions).",dismissal incredulity unbelievable proposition appeal fallacy false sounds because as,"['absurd', 'baseless', 'laughable', 'ludicrous', 'outrageous', 'ridiculous', 'unacceptable', 'unbelievable', 'unreal', 'unrealistic', 'unreasonable']"
Appeal to Money Fallacy,Desires,"The Appeal to Money Fallacy can occur with respect either to people or to things. With respect to people, the fallacy is the belief that the more money a person has, the wiser or more knowledgeable they are. With respect to things, the fallacy is the belief that the more something costs, the more valuable it must be. One response to this fallacy could be to challenge it directly. Another approach could be to leverage it by placing a price on the relevant training, equipment and/or other materials required to engage in the behavior.",wiser knowledgeable appeal fallacy valuable occur costs respect belief money,"['cheaper', 'cost', 'costing', 'costly', 'costs', 'expensive', 'invaluable', 'money', 'profitable', 'valuable', 'value']"
Appeal to Motive Fallacy,Desires,"The Appeal to Motive Fallacy is the claim an argument must be false because the person making it has biased or ulterior motives. Avoid allowing people with relevant conflicts of interest to be the ones promoting behavior change. For example, if someone is selling a high-protein product, it would likely be unwise to choose them as the person to raise awareness (e.g., through a workshop) of the recommended daily protein requirements for a particular demographic/target audience. (As well as possibly inhibiting the degree to which people benefit from the workshop, owing to the appeal to motive fallacy, it would also be unethical due to the conflict of interest, and due to the missed opportunity to provide important health information in a way in which it would be taken seriously by the audience.)",ulterior motives motive appeal biased fallacy false argument claim making,"['intent', 'intention', 'intentions', 'motivations', 'motive', 'motives', 'premeditated', 'purpose', 'purposes', 'rationale', 'ulterior']"
Appeal to Nature Fallacy,Desires,"The Appeal to Nature Fallacy is the claim that natural things are automatically good and synthetic things are automatically bad. In cases where this fallacy is encouraging a positive behavior or discouraging a negative one, this may not need to be rectified. In cases where this fallacy is counterproductive, a benevolent helper could point out counterexamples to demonstrate that this is a fallacy. This might be more effective if there is evidence available to demonstrate positive outcomes associated with the behavior in question (if that is what is perceived as unnatural), or to demonstrate the negative outcomes associated with an undesired, but natural, behavior.",synthetic appeal fallacy automatically natural nature claim bad things good,"['acids', 'additives', 'artificial', 'cis', 'latex', 'man-made', 'manmade', 'molecule', 'molecules', 'natural', 'nature', 'physiological', 'synthetic']"
Appeal to Pity Fallacy,Considers,"The Appeal to Pity Fallacy is the attempt to induce pity to sway opponents. In cases where this fallacy is encouraging a positive behavior or discouraging a negative one, this may not need to be rectified. In cases where this fallacy is counterproductive, a benevolent helper could point out counterexamples to demonstrate that this is a fallacy. An example of when the appeal to pity fallacy could be counterproductive could be if someone is considering encouraging another party to engage in a behavior that would be positive, but potentially challenging (such as encouraging a friend to stop chain smoking) - in such a scenario, someone might decide not to ask the other party to consider the behavior change because of some pity-based reason (e.g., my friend is under a lot of stress right now, so now wouldn't be the time to bring to their attention that there's a new quitting-aid on the market - it would probably just stress them out further). In such a situation, it might be helpful to notice when emotions are unduly influencing one's decisions, and to seek as many differnet perspectives and sources of information as possible (rather than relying on one's intuitions and emotional reactions), when trying to determine the best course of action.",sway induce pity opponents appeal fallacy attempt is to the,"['admiration', 'compassion', 'grief', 'insult', 'pity', 'regret', 'sad', 'shame', 'sorry', 'sympathy']"

In cases where this fallacy is encouraging a positive behavior or discouraging a negative one, this may not need to be rectified.

In cases where this fallacy is counterproductive, a benevolent helper could point out that this fallacy is affecting the decision to engage in a behavior (or not), and that this may not be justified. If this fallacy is weighing heavily on the person's decision, it might be worth trying to encourage only very specific and incremental behavioral changes at first, to reduce the resistance associated with breaking from the status quo.

Appeal to Wishful Thinking,Desires,"The Appeal to Wishful Thinking Fallacy is the belief that a claim is true or false just because you strongly hope it is. When the wishful thinking someone is employing relates to strongly-held beliefs, or distorts their reasoning about what is true, then similar strategies could apply here as to the Appeal to Consequences fallacy. For less strongly-held hopes, or in situations where the backfire risk is deemed to be sufficiently low, it may be helpful to point out when this is occurring.

Argument from Fallacy,Desires,"The Argument from Fallacy Fallacy (sometimes just called the ""Fallacy Fallacy"") is the argument that, because an embedded argument contains a flaw, its conclusion must be false. It usually has the following form (where P is an embedded argument): ""If P is sound or strong, then P's conclusion is true. P is unsound or not strong. Therefore, P's conclusion is false."" It might be possible to reduce the probability of this fallacy arising, if care is taken not to promote a positive behavior (or discourage a negative one) in a way that employs fallacies. If the fallacy has already occurred, though, then in cases where the end result is people being encouraged to engage in a positive behavior or being discouraged from a negative behavior, it may not need to be rectified.

Availability Cascade,Desires,"Availability Cascade refers to a self-reinforcing cycle in which simple and apparently insightful ideas automatically spread faster than complex, obscure ideas, even if they oversimplify to the point of inaccuracy.

Availability Heuristic,Desires,"The Availability Heuristic is a phenomenon (which can result in a cognitive bias) in which people predict the frequency of an event, or a proportion within a population, based on how easily an example can be brought to mind. This bias may be helpful if a desirable behavior can be made more available and more likely to come to mind when someone is considering the range of behaviors that they could engage in. If possible, the physical and social environment should make the desired behavior - and its positive consequences - more salient, memorable, and accessible in recent memory. If you increase the salience, memorability and accessibility of the behavior and its positive consequences, people may be more likely to think about how to put plans in place to make it a reality, more likely to desire it (if the mere exposure effect also comes into play), more likely to think about it at moments of critical behavioral opportunities, more likely to think of that positive outcomes of the behavior are likely (if these are more available in memory), more likely to think that their efforts at change will succeed (if examples of success are more available in memory), more likely to think of it before thinking of alternative behaviors (if the behavior has been made available in memory more recently than the alternative behaviors), and more likely to be seen as something that they should, can and will continue (if the behavior, its consequences, or reminders of it are available in recent memory).

Backtracking Effect,Desires,"The Backtracking Effect refers to the fact that people don't like undoing or re-doing what they've already done, even when they recognize that they've made a mistake. All else being equal, when people realize they've made a mistake, they prefer to perform new work rather than to expend the same amount of effort undoing or re-doing the previous work. If this effect is reducing someone's willingness to replace an old habit with a new one (e.g., because they see unlearning an old habit as a form of backtracking), then it may be helpful to frame the new habit as a new opportunity, rather than something that needs to ""replace"" an old habit. On the other hand, this fallacy might be helpful once someone has reached the Maintains condition, because if they see the continuation of the new behavior as necessary in order to avoid backtracking, then they may be more motivated to avoid any lapses in that behavior - so in those situations, it may be helpful to point out to the person how far they have come in order to motivated them not to go backwards on their behavioral goals.

Bandwagon Effect,Desires,"The Bandwagon Effect is the tendency to do or believe things because many other people do or believe the same. It is a phenomenon observed primarily within the fields of microeconomics, political science, and behaviorism. Encourage users to adopt a behavior change because ""everyone else is doing it."" (Conversely, if ""everyone"" is not exhibiting the target behavior, then the user may feel that they are going against the grain by adopting the new behavior, and thus this effect may have to be overcome by emphasizing other positive aspects of adoption.)",bandwagon tendency phenomenon fields primarily observed political effect within science,"['bandwagon', 'common', 'embrace', 'everyone', 'hype', 'lemmings', 'mainstream', 'majority', 'meme', 'popular', 'popularity', 'soapbox', 'synonymous', 'wagon']"
Base Rate Neglect,Desires,"Base Rate Neglect, or Base Rate Fallacy or Bias, is an error that occurs when the conditional probability of some hypothesis H, given some evidence E, is assessed without taking into account the ""base rate"" or ""prior probability"" of H and the total probability of evidence E. Help people to increase their weighting of background or contextual information in a given situation. Example #1: It is known that 1 in 10,000 people have a certain kind of cancer, and it is also known that a test for that kind of cancer performed on 10,000 people will yield 100 positives; therefore, the test has a false positive rate of 99 out of 10,000. If a doctor performs the test on a patient but fails to consider the background information (that 1 in 10,000 people have that kind of cancer) and only considers the information provided by the test (that 100 in 10,000 people have that kind of cancer), then she will very likely misdiagnose a positive result from the test as being true when it is much more likely that a positive result is false. Example #2: It is known that only a very small percentage of startups last longer than two years. Your startup seems to be doing really well, so you have very high confidence that it'll last longer than two years. However, this confidence is likely to be misplaced given the background information that most startups fail. You don't necessarily have to work out the math with people (as in Example #1), but it's still useful to help people find ways to evaluate their scenario-specific information relative to the broader context (as in Example #2).",assessed neglect conditional hypothesis bias probability fallacy prior occurs base,"['correlation', 'likelihood', 'likely', 'placebo', 'possibility', 'prior', 'probabilities', 'probability', 'probable', 'risk', 'statistically']"
Begging the Question Fallacy,Desires,"Begging the Question occurs when a proposition to be proven is assumed implicitly or explicitly in the premises of the argument. (The fallacy can also occur if the assumed premise is actually stronger and more controversial than the proposition that's being debated.) This could affect the accuracy of any of a person's beliefs. If the flawed premise is leading the person to have beliefs that discourage them from desiring, planning for or engaging in a positive behavior, then it may help to point this fallacy out to them and to encourage them to decide what they would believe if they started without their inaccurate or unnecessarily strong premise.",debated begging controversial premises implicitly proposition fallacy stronger premise explicitly,"['assume', 'circular', 'construed', 'disclaimer', 'explicit', 'explicitly', 'herein', 'implicit', 'proof', 'subjective', 'tacit', 'unambiguous']"
Belief Bias,Desires,"Belief Bias refers to a tendency to base one's degree of support for a set of arguments on the perceived believability of the *conclusion*, rather than how strongly the presented arguments support that conclusion. Show people that the conclusions from experiments or arguments are not always intuitive or even believable by providing examples from history. For example, the conclusion that the Earth revolved around the sun seemed impossible to many people when it was discovered; and the effects of relativity and quantum mechanics feel extremely counterintuitive to people who encounter them for the first time.",perceived tendency bias refers strongly presented one's degree conclusion arguments,"['absurd', 'disgusting', 'laughable', 'ludicrous', 'outrageous', 'rediculous', 'ridiculous', 'silly', 'stupid', 'unbelievable', 'unreal']"
Bias Blind Spot,Desires,"A Bias Blind Spot refers to a tendency to see oneself as being less susceptible to biases (such as those listed on this site) than others in the population. If someone is trying to compensate for cognitive biases as listed in this table, it might be helpful to remind them that they are likely to be underestimating the degree to which all of the biases apply to them, and that they might therefore benefit from correcting for the biases (or trying to do so) more than they would have expected.

Burden of Proof Fallacy,Desires,"Burden of Proof Fallacy refers to the assumption that one's own argument is true unless explicitly disproven, and that the onus is on those who hold alternative viewpoints to disprove that view. In cases where this fallacy is encouraging a positive behavior or discouraging a negative one, this may not need to be rectified. In cases where this fallacy is counterproductive, a benevolent helper could point out when it is occurring. Over the longer-term, it might help to encourage people to practice epistemic humility and probabilistic thinking, because if they are willing to admit their beliefs could be wrong, and if they have an understanding of the concepts of probability and uncertainty, then they may be less likely to have beliefs of such a strong nature (that they insist on believing until someone goes to an effort to prove them wrong).",disproven onus viewpoints disprove refers fallacy burden explicitly assumption one's,"['blame', 'burden', 'obligation', 'overburdened', 'proof', 'responsibility', 'responsiblity', 'strain', 'toll', 'yoke']"
Change Bias in Memory,Maintains,"Change Bias in Memory refers to a phenomenon in which someone who engages in effortful behavior change later remembers their past performance or behavior as being more challenging than it was in reality. See also: Choice-Supportive Bias. In cases where this bias is encouraging a positive behavior (which it might, e.g., if someone has reached the maintenance stage and if this bias is making them think that their past way of doing things was suboptimal) or if it is discouraging a negative behavior, this may not need to be rectified. In cases where this fallacy is counterproductive, a benevolent helper could point out when it is occurring, or could attempt to reduce the chance that it happens in the future by encouraging people to keep a diary documenting their efforts over time (so that they can return to previous entries to remind themselves of how effortful their past performance actually was).",engages remembers challenging bias phenomenon refers behavior reality performance past,"['change', 'defrag', 'forget', 'memories', 'memory', 'refresh', 'remember', 'remembered', 'remembering', 'rewind']"

In cases where this fallacy is encouraging a positive behavior or discouraging a negative one, this may not need to be rectified. In cases where this fallacy is counterproductive, a benevolent helper could point out when it is occurring, and could offer more representative sources of information.

Childhood Amnesia in Memory,Desires,"Childhood Amnesia in Memory refers to an individual's relative lack of memories from before the age of four. This phenomenon does not seem to be particularly likely to affect behavior change efforts in substantial ways, but it is theoretically possible that it might in certain situations, in which case the impact of the phenomenon could be explored. In cases where this phenomenon is encouraging a positive behavior or discouraging a negative one, this may not need to be rectified. In cases where it is counterproductive, a benevolent helper could point out when it is occurring. For example, if someone has a particular belief about their early childhood, or has some distress about not remembering their early childhood, and if this is affecting their current desires, intentions or likelihood of engaging in a particular behavior (or its alternatives), then it might help to explore this idea with them so that they realise their belief (about having memories from certain ages, or about being unusual for not having them) may not be accurate.",amnesia individual's memories childhood refers relative age lack four memory,"['amnesia', 'coma', 'concussion', 'consciousness', 'dizziness', 'forget', 'forgotten', 'memories', 'memory', 'remember', 'remembering', 'vertigo']"
Choice-supportive Bias,Maintains,"Choice-Supportive Bias refers to a cognitive bias whereby someone who has made a choice between different options later remembers the option that they chose as having more positive attributes than it did at the time (while the options they did not choose are remembered as having more negative attributes than they'd had at the time). Help people to notice the ways in which they seek to justify their old behavior. People may often overweight the benefits of the old behavior as a way of justifying that behavior, so helping them to notice that they're doing this may help them to be more mindful about giving up the old behavior and adopting the new behavior.",remembers cognitive whereby remembered attributes bias refers chose they'd negative,"['choice', 'choices', 'choose', 'choosing', 'congratulate', 'congratulations', 'endorse', 'remember', 'support', 'thank']"
Chronological Snobbery Fallacy,Desires,"Chronological Snobbery Fallacy refers to a bias against arguments, thought, or work from historically earlier time periods, merely due to the perception of having arisen at a ""less advanced"" time period than the present. In cases where this fallacy is encouraging a positive behavior or discouraging a negative one, this may not need to be rectified. In cases where this fallacy is counterproductive, a benevolent helper could point out counterexamples to demonstrate that this is a fallacy. Alternatively, they could point out more credible people/organizations who *also* believe the behavior is a good idea (i.e. evading the direct challenge of this fallacy by appealing to authority, instead of addressing the fact that less authoritative people also believe the same thing). For example, it has been believed that getting enough sleep is beneficial for health for some time, but this does not make the belief that sleep is important for health an invalid one (indeed, there are many longitudinal studies demonstrating measurable health benefits associated with adequate [but not excessive] levels of sleep).",snobbery chronological arisen historically periods perception bias refers fallacy advanced,"['arrogance', 'arrogant', 'bigot', 'condescending', 'cynic', 'history', 'hypocrisy', 'hypocrite', 'idiot', 'naive', 'snob', 'stupidity', 'time']"

Clustering Illusion,Desires,"The Clustering Illusion refers to a tendency to see patterns or clusters in samples drawn from random distributions. Show examples of people inaccurately finding patterns where they don't exist. For example, a person might think they notice that they tend to win more at a casino when wearing a certain tie; so they choose to wear a tie the next time they go to the casino, and they end up losing a lot of money.

Context Effect in Memory,Remembers,"Context-dependent memory refers to improved retrieval (or recall) of specific memories if the context present at the time of memory retrieval is the same as the context present at the time the memory was first stored (or encoded). This effect may make it particularly important to increase the salience of the behavior in certain contexts (e.g., especially contexts in which the behavior happens less frequently), and may make it more important to remind people of the beneficial effects of the behavior (especially in new contexts where they are less likely to have seen examples of such effects recently). In the maintenance stage, this may be important to take into consideration when someone is planning to move their behavior from one context to another (as it might be less likely that they remember to engage in the behavior if they switch to a different context) - possible ways to address this could include planning ahead and increasing the number of both physical and social reminders to engage in the behavior.",context-dependent retrieval memories encoded refers improved stored context recall present,"['context', 'decipher', 'decrypt', 'defrag', 'login', 'lookup', 'memory', 'password', 'remember', 'retrieve', 'retrieved', 'situation', 'specific', 'time', 'unsubscribe']"
Contrast Effect,Desires,"The Contrast Effect refers to the way in which someone's perception of something (e.g., a particular room temperature) can be distorted (relative to objective measurement, or relative to their typical experience) due to simultaneous or recent exposure to something that contrasts with it (e.g., a warmer outside temperature).

Correlation Implies Causation Fallacy,Desires,"The Correlation Implies Causation Fallacy, as its name implies, is the fallacious assumption that correlation between two variables automatically implies that one causes the other.

Denying the Antecedent Fallacy,Intends,"Denying the Antecedent Fallacy is a logical fallacy about the relationships between categories or assertions. For the purpose of explaining this fallacy, let's imagine there are two categories of things, labeled as ""P"" and ""Q."" The Denying the Antecedent Fallacy takes the following form: ""If P, then Q. Not P. Therefore, not Q."" The fallacy is assuming that the third statement follows from the first two, although it doesn't follow (e.g., because there can be cases of Q that are not preceded by P). Just because Q always follows *if* P is true, this doesn't mean that Q must always be preceded by P.) In cases where this fallacy is encouraging a positive behavior or discouraging a negative one, this may not need to be rectified. In cases where this fallacy is counterproductive, a benevolent helper could point out this fallacy and/or point out counterexamples. For example, if someone notes that people who go to the gym regularly become physically fit, and then thinks that anyone who doesn't go to the gym regularly cannot become physically fit, then they would have succumbed to this fallacy and might be less likely to consider the full range of options available to them for meeting the goal of becoming physically fit. By pointing out the flaw in this reasoning, it may be possible to open up a wider range of possible plans that the person could form (e.g., in order to meet their behavioral goals).",antecedent preceded relationships assertions labeled categories denying explaining fallacy logical,"['after', 'analogy', 'antecedent', 'axiomatic', 'deny', 'hadith', 'hypothesis', 'motive', 'premise', 'refutation', 'subjective', 'syllogism', 'theism']"
Disjunction Fallacy,Desires,"The Disjunction Fallacy refers to an error in probabilistic reasoning, whereby people estimate that the probability of an event happening exceeds the probability of *either* that event *or* another event happening. When talking about the probability of two events (let's call them A and B), if you want to talk about the probability of *either* event occuring (i.e., the probability of *either* A occuring OR B occuring), this can be referred to as the disjunction of those events. The probability that *either* event occurs will be larger than the individual probabilities of A occuring or of B occuring. When someone believes that the probability of one of the individual events somehow exceeds the probability of the disjunction of those events, they have fallen prey to the Disjunction Fallacy. In cases where this fallacy is encouraging a positive behavior or discouraging a negative one, this may not need to be rectified.

Disregard of Regression Toward the Mean,Maintains,"Disregard of Regression Toward the Mean refers to any case of reasoning that fails to take into account the tendency for random events to exhibit regression toward the mean. ""Regression toward the mean"" refers to the observation that when sampling a random variable, an extreme (or very unlikely) outcome will, on average, be followed by less extreme outcomes. (Note that the Gambler's Fallacy does *not* represent a rational solution to this problem, because in Gambler's Fallacy the person believes that a future event ""compensates"" for a past event, and that is not what is happening in regression toward the mean.) In cases where this fallacy is encouraging a positive behavior or discouraging a negative one, this may not need to be rectified. In cases where this fallacy is counterproductive, a benevolent helper could point out this fallacy and/or point out counterexamples. If someone is disregarding the tendency for performance to regress toward the mean, they may be unrealistically optimistic about their behavior change goals and their probability of meeting and sticking to those goals, so it might be beneficial to point this fallacy out to them if it helps them to better plan ahead, set more realistic expectations, and give themselves more credit for the rising to the challenge of engaging in the behavior despite it not being what they are necessarily statistically likely to do.",compensates gambler's outcomes regression sampling exhibit tendency disregard outcome refers,"['average', 'correlation', 'disregard', 'percentages', 'prevalence', 'probabilities', 'probability', 'regression', 'statistic', 'statistical', 'statistics']"
Distinction Bias,Chooses,"Distinction Bias refers to a tendency to view two options as more dissimilar to each other when they are being simultaneously evaluated than when they are being separately evaluated. Bring the old behavior and the new behavior into contrast, exploring the pros and cons of each.

In cases where this fallacy is counterproductive, a benevolent helper could point out this fallacy and/or point out counterexamples. For example, if someone was assuming that anyone who engages in a particular behavior ""must"" have a certain set of characteristics, and if they believed those characteristics were not desirable, then it could be helpful to point out the fallacy in their argument in order to encourage them to reconsider a behavior that they may have otherwise dismissed as undesirable.",ecological wherein characteristics fallacy category reasoning assumed logical statements apply,"['all', 'applies', 'apply', 'categories', 'category', 'classification', 'division', 'divisions', 'qualify', 'segment', 'some', 'specialize']"
Dunning–Kruger Effect,Knows,"The Dunning-Kruger Effect refers to a phenomenon in which people who are less adept at a particular skill appear to overestimate their abilities (suffering from illusory superiority), while those who are more highly skilled appear to underestimate their abilities (suffering from illusory inferiority). As Kruger and Dunning noted, ""the miscalibration of the incompetent stems from an error about the self, whereas the miscalibration of the highly competent stems from an error about others"". In cases where this effect is encouraging a positive behavior or discouraging a negative one, this may not need to be rectified. In cases where this fallacy is counterproductive, a benevolent helper could point out this effect and/or point out examples of ways in which it might apply. For example, if someone was assuming that they already know enough information to be able to perform a complex new behavior, it might help to point out to them that people with less knowledge of an area are less equipped to assess their own skill level in that area and less equipped to understand the relative difficulty of that behavior (which can also contribute to the Planning Fallacy). If the person is equipped with this knowledge and takes it into consideration, this may enable them to set more realistic expectations and goals, which might increase the chance that they remain motivated to continue improving their skills over time and to maintain the behavior over time.",overestimate inferiority dunning illusory adept stems superiority underestimate skilled incompetent,"['ascribe', 'competent', 'estimate', 'incompetent', 'infallible', 'inferior', 'misrepresent', 'misunderstand', 'outweigh', 'overestimate', 'skill', 'subjective', 'superior', 'underestimate']"

Egocentric Bias,Desires,"[note to self - need to come back to this row. it seems that egocentric bias is a broader term than this description would suggest] This occurs when people claim more personal responsibility for the results of a joint action than an outside observer would credit them.

In cases where this bias is counterproductive, a benevolent helper could point out this effect and/or point out examples of ways in which it might apply. However, this bias might be motivating and might encourage positive behaviors in many situations: for example, if someone has committed to a particular behavior change because they believe it will contribute to a group activity or goal, then if they imagine that they have a large role to play in that group activity or goal, this would increase the perceived importance of them planning and successfully engaging in the desired behavior.

Etymological Fallacy,Desires,"The Etymological Fallacy refers to a fallacious assumption that the historical meaning of a word or phrase is necessarily similar to (or can be used to clarify) its present-day meaning. In cases where this fallacy is encouraging a positive behavior (such as by a positive association with some word that the person incorrectly assumes is related to a word that describes the behavior), or discouraging a negative one (such as by an historically negative connotation of a word that describes a negative behavior), this may not need to be rectified. In cases where this bias is counterproductive, a benevolent helper could point out this fallacy if/when it has already occurred. Alternatively, they could try to avoid situations where the fallacy arises in the first place, by being as careful and accurate as possible (both in the actual content of information, and in the ways in which the information is likely to be interpreted, taking the etymological fallacy into account) in the way they communicate about the behavior.",etymological present-day fallacious clarify refers fallacy phrase assumption historical meaning,"['current', 'dictionary', 'etymology', 'history', 'idiom', 'lexicon', 'meanings', 'modern', 'origin', 'origins', 'phrase', 'proverb', 'proverbs', 'similar', 'slang', 'verb', 'word']"

Fading Affect Bias in Memory,Maintains,"Fading Affect Bias in Memory refers to a tendency for the emotion(s) associated with unpleasant memories to fade more quickly than the emotion(s) associated with pleasant memories. In cases where this bias is encouraging a positive behavior or if it is discouraging a negative behavior, this may not need to be rectified. In cases where this fallacy is counterproductive, a benevolent helper could point out when it is occurring, or could attempt to reduce the chance that it happens in the future by encouraging people to keep a diary documenting their affective experiences over time (so that they can return to previous entries to remind themselves of how emotionally varied [as opposed to uniformly positive] their past experiences actually were). This may be particularly important to ensure the Maintains condition continues to be met (otherwise the person may be at risk of becoming demotivated, if they believe that things were better before they changed their behavior in this way).",fading unpleasant fade emotion memories pleasant tendency bias refers affect,"['affect', 'depressing', 'emotion', 'emotional', 'emotions', 'fade', 'feeling', 'negative', 'pleasant', 'positive', 'subjective', 'unpleasant']"
Fallacy of Composition,Desires,"The Fallacy of Composition refers to the fallacious assumption that something is true of the whole simply because it is true of some part of the whole (or even of every proper part of the whole). In cases where this fallacy is encouraging a positive behavior, or discouraging a negative one, this may not need to be rectified. In cases where this bias is counterproductive, a benevolent helper could point out this fallacy and/or provide counterexamples. This fallacy might be particularly relevant for people who desire and/or are planning for or enacting a behavior, but who differ significantly from the majority of people who engage in that behavior. The same benefits and risks that apply to a large subgroup (e.g., neurotypical individuals without mental illness) may not apply to subpopulations who differ in meaningful ways from that majority (e.g., people who do not fit into that category), and this might lead people in that subpopulation to form unrealistic expectations, unrealistic plans, unrealistic risk:benefit evaluations, and unwarranted optimism (or pessimism) regarding their ability to maintain the behavior once they have started it. By realising the ways in which they differ from the rest of the population, this might help the subpopulation to more realistically plan, think about, enact and maintain the behavior (perhaps using different strategies from the rest of the population). For example, regularly practicing mindfulness meditation has been shown in multiple studies to produce mental health benefits, but this does not imply that regular mindfulness meditation would benefit everyone (and there are some subpopulations with mental health concerns that might preclude them from some of the benefits, e.g., people with dissociative identity disorder or a history of trauma might in some cases be harmed rather than helped by some of the states induced by mindfulness meditation). Those people may then be disappointed or actively harmed in their attempt to start and continue a behavior that is being recommended to the general population (unless they adapt the behavior and their way of enacting it to suit their particular needs).",fallacious composition refers fallacy assumption proper whole simply true every,"['atoms', 'composed', 'composition', 'dynamics', 'morphology', 'part', 'redraws', 'subjective', 'texture', 'varies', 'whole']"
Fallacy of False Dilemma,Desires,"Involves a situation in which only two alternatives are considered, when in fact there are additional options. In cases where this fallacy is encouraging a positive behavior (e.g., ""you either engage in this important behavior from now on or you don't"" - if such reasoning is motivating [rather than discouraging] for the person in question, then this might be helpful in encouraging the positive behavior), or discouraging a negative one, this may not need to be rectified. In cases where this bias is counterproductive (e.g., when black and white thinking is counterproductive for someone sticking to their goals after temporary lapses), a benevolent helper could point out this fallacy and/or could provide ideas for alternative options beyond the two that the person is currently considering.

Fallacy of Gray,Maintains,"The Fallacy of Gray is a belief that because nothing is certain, everything is equally uncertain. (That is, this fallacy overlooks the fact that it is possible to quantify and to compare different levels of uncertainty.) In cases where this fallacy is encouraging a positive behavior, or discouraging a negative one, this may not need to be rectified. In cases where this bias is counterproductive (e.g., when someone doesn't distinguish between a minor, a moderate or a major lapse in the behavior, leading them to potentially underplay the importance of the maintenance stage, and/or to fail altogether at this stage), a benevolent helper could point out this fallacy and/or could point out counterexamples.

Fallacy of the Single Cause,Intends,"Fallacy of the Single Cause refers to a fallacious assumption that there is a single cause of an outcome (whereas in reality, the outcome may instead be attributable to a number of only jointly sufficient causes). In cases where this fallacy is encouraging a positive behavior (e.g., by encouraging people to believe that a specific positive behavior is all that they need in order to be happy,) or discouraging a negative one, this may actually increase the probability of positive behaviors being desired and enacted in the short-term, but it might also lead to unrealistic expectations regarding the outcomes of the behavior change in question, and might lead to greater disappointment and demotivation when those expectations are not met. In cases where this fallacy is counterproductive, a benevolent helper could point out that this is a fallacy by sharing examples or evidence demonstrating that the phenomenon in question would not have happened if some of the jointly sufficient causes were not present (e.g., pointing out that someone who engages in regular physical activity would not have been able to get back into a healthy weight range if they did not also e.g., consult with a dietician and adjust their caloric intake as well). Noting when this fallacy is occurring could be particularly helpful in cases where someone needs assistance forming realistic plans to start the behavior, has formed unrealistic expectations about the effects of the behavior and/or its advantages over alternative behaviors, or has formed unrealistic expectations regarding the sufficient conditions for maintenance of the behavior. By questioning their assumptions and developing a better understanding of the sufficient causes of specific outcomes, they might be better-equipped to form more realistic plans, which should increase the chances of successfully starting and maintaining the behavior in question.",attributable jointly fallacious outcome refers fallacy whereas assumption sufficient causes,"['ascribe', 'attribute', 'attributed', 'cause', 'causes', 'factor', 'factors', 'many', 'multiple', 'outcome', 'result', 'single', 'subjective']"
Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle,Desires,"Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle is a logical fallacy about the relationships between categories or assertions. For the purpose of explaining this fallacy, let's imagine there are three categories of things, labeled as ""A,"" ""Y,"" and ""Z."" The Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle has the following form: ""All Zs are As. Y is an A. So Y is a Z."" The fallacy is to assume that the third statement follows from the previous two, but it does not. (It would instead follow from the following: ""All As are Zs, and Y is an A."") In cases where this fallacy is encouraging a positive behavior, or discouraging a negative one, this may actually increase the probability of positive behaviors being desired and enacted in the short-term (and so might not need to be rectified immediately), but it might also lead to unrealistic expectations regarding the outcomes of the behavior change in question, which might decrease the chances of the person successfully engaging in and maintaining a desired behavior change. In such cases, it might help to point out the fallacy and to encourage the person to reconsider the situation and/or to gather more information in order to form more accurate beliefs.",zs relationships assertions labeled categories explaining fallacy logical follows z,"['allegation', 'assertion', 'assertions', 'assumption', 'category', 'distribute', 'group', 'hypothesis', 'middle', 'notion', 'premise', 'statement', 'stereotype']"
False Analogy Fallacy,Intends,"The False Analogy Fallacy refers to a fallacious assumption that if two things are similar in some ways, and if one of those things has a certain property, then the other thing will also have that property. For example, if we call these two things A and B, the False Analogy Fallacy has the following form: ""A and B are similar in some ways. A has property X, therefore B has property X."" If B does not have property X, then this represents an example of the False Analogy Fallacy. In cases where this fallacy is encouraging a positive behavior, or discouraging a negative one, this may actually increase the probability of positive behaviors being desired and enacted in the short-term (and so might not need to be rectified immediately), but it might also lead to unrealistic expectations regarding the outcomes of the behavior change in question, which might decrease the chances of the person successfully engaging in and maintaining a desired behavior change in the longer-term. In such cases, it might be helpful to point out the fallacy and to work towards forming a more realistic appraisal of the situation in question, in order to form more realistic plans for commencing and continuing the behavior. For example, if someone observes that someone else has decided to engage in the same positive behavior as them, and if their choice was based on the same value (e.g., both of them value fitness and have chosen to increase their activity levels), then they may erroneously assume that they will also have other characteristics in common with the person (e.g., they may assume they both need to meet the goal in the same way and will run into the same challenges). If this fallacy is identified and actively avoided, then this should increase the degree to which the person seeks information from a wider range of (non-anecdotal) sources before forming (hopefully more realistic) plans for implementing and maintaining the behavior.",fallacious refers fallacy analogy represents assumption property false ways form,"['analogies', 'analogy', 'ascribe', 'attribute', 'cite', 'correlation', 'equate', 'metaphor', 'parallels', 'property', 'similar', 'subjective']"
False Consensus Effect,Considers,"The False Consensus Effect refers to a tendency to overestimate the degree to which others agree with one's own opinions, and to overestimate the relative normality of one's beliefs. This effect may reduce the probability that someone seeking to promote a positive behavior to others (e.g., a health promotion officer) realizes that others are not even aware of the possibility of the behavior or its positive outcomes. By considering this effect and planning for it, the person promoting the behavior may be more likely to seek information regarding the current state of knowledge (or ignorance) of the target audience, which may then help them to plan how best to increase their awareness of the positive behavior. The effect may also affect the way someone plans, implements and maintains a behavioral change (e.g., if they assume that everyone agrees with them, they may not adequately plan for some potential setbacks, such as peer pressure to restart smoking).",overestimate tendency consensus refers relative one's degree beliefs false effect,"['agree', 'consensus', 'estimate', 'estimates', 'estimating', 'forecast', 'normality', 'predict', 'prediction', 'predictions', 'projection', 'projections']"
Focusing Effect,Desires,"The Focusing Effect (or Focusing Illusion) refers to a cognitive bias wherein people place too much importance on one piece of information, or one aspect of an event (especially the aspect they happen to be thinking about), when drawing a conclusion or predicting an outcome. (Note: this bias relates to the way in which someone thinks about something, making it distinct from Attentional Bias, which relates to specific features of the environment.)

Forer (or Barnum) Effect,Desires,"The Forer Effect refers to a tendency for people to ascribe high levels of accuracy to a description of their personality that is presented as being tailored to them, despite the fact that it is vague enough to apply to a wide range of people. This effect may increase the degree to which people identify with materials distributed to them regarding the behavior and/or its potential benefits in someone's life (e.g., if a pamphlet is distributed offering ideas for low-cost aerobic activity for people to try, and if it includes statements such as ""if your busy lifestyle leaves you with very little time to plan to exercise..."", then the Forer effect might mean that the readers perceive the material as being more relevant to them and their specific situation than it really is - and for some people, this might increases their desire to engage in the behavior in question). Thus, in cases where this effect is encouraging a positive behavior or discouraging a negative one, this effect may not need to be rectified and could instead be leveraged to increase the chances of desired outcomes. In cases where this effect is counterproductive, on the other hand, then a benevolent helper could point it out and provide suggestions for alternative ways of thinking about the situation in question.

Forward Bias,Maintains,"[can delete this one. note to self - need to come back to this one and follow up on the comments in this cell by Josh and Spencer. Maybe better to skip this one due to maybe confusing people due to it being much more commonly associated with the physics concept rather than a psychological bias?] The tendency to create models based on past data which are validated only against that past data. In cases where this bias is encouraging a positive behavior or discouraging a negative one, this may have beneficial outcomes in the short-term. However, in the longer-term, it could also lead people to form unrealistic plans and expectations regarding the probability of successfully starting and continuing the behavior as soon as they make any positive progress on it (or e.g., based on experiencing it as novel and easy at the start), and this may lead to disappointment and/or demotivation when their unrealistic plans and expectations later fail to be met. A benevolent helper could encourage someone to actively plan for the unexpected, and to realise that their predictions about the future could be inaccurate. This might decrease the shock and disappointment someone experiences following setbacks, which might increase their chances of successfully sticking to their goals in the longer-term. Another way to help in the longer-term might be to encourage the person to practice probabilistic thinking, and to become more understanding of the inherent uncertainty in all predictions.",validated tendency skip cell psychological bias josh commonly spencer confusing,"['backward', 'backwards', 'cursor', 'data', 'downward', 'forward', 'model', 'past', 'puck', 'rewind', 'sideways', 'toward', 'upward']"

Fundamental Attribution Error,Has,"Fundamental Attribution Error refers to a tendency for people to explain others' behaviors in a way that overemphasizes their personal characteristics and underemphasizes environmental or situational factors. When people observe others experiencing the positive effects of a behavior, they may be more likely to attribute people's success to personal characteristics, rather than to the environmental and social facilitators of the behavior and its outcomes. This might lead them to form unrealistic expectations regarding the relative importance of personal characteristics in achieving the behavior change and its associated outcomes, and may therefore cause them not to consider other important barriers and enablers to their behavior change efforts (e.g., in their physical and social environment). While this may negatively impact on their ability to successfully set realistic intentions, act on and maintain the behavior, it might also cause them to focus on developing specific personal characteristics and/or knowledge which could nevertheless help them in other ways. Thus, the relative (dis)advantages associated with this effect could vary according to which condition for change is most important to meet to facilitate the behavior in question. In cases where this effect is having an overall positive impact on the person's behavior change efforts, this may not need to be rectified. In cases where this effect is counterproductive, a benevolent helper could point it out and could provide suggestions for alternative ways of thinking about the situation in question.

Gambler's Fallacy,Desires,"Gambler's Fallacy refers to a the belief that, in a series of randomly occurring events, if one event happened less frequently than expected in the recent past, then it is more likely to happen in the future (or vice versa). This fallacy could be addressed by pointing it out directly, and/or by explaining the reason that it is a fallacy. This fallacy may cause people to erroneously assume that just because a trend in one direction has been observed in the recent past, a trend in the opposite direction might be anticipated soon afterwards. This could negatively impact the degree to which they form realistic plans, follow through on enacting and maintaining the behavior, and the degree to which they accurately perceive and desire the behavior in the first place. For example, if someone reads news articles about nutrition-related research, they may come to the conclusion that the conclusions reached by studies are a random process and that soon after the nutritional benefits of specific food items are demonstrated in studies, there will also be a series of directly contradictory studies, where the same food is found to have negative health impacts. If they then assume that this will apply all the time, they might decide to try to get one step ahead and to base their diet on their arbitrary predictions about which studies are about to be contradicted next. If they were instead aware of the fallacy of this reasoning, they might then employ less bizarre methods of planning their diet.

Genetic Fallacy,Desires,"Genetic Fallacy refers to the fallacious assumption that the origins of something determine its current significance or meaning. In cases where this fallacy is encouraging a positive behavior (such as by a positive association between the behavior and its historical origins), or discouraging a negative one (such as by an historically negative connotation of a behavior that also happens to be negative today), this may not need to be rectified.

Guilt by Association,Desires,"Guilt by Association can refer to any attempt to discredit an idea or claim by associating it with an undesirable person or group. Avoid having a positive behavior promoted by people who are perceived as undesirable (or who belong to a group perceived to be undesirable). For example, if someone was planning how to best increase the desirability of a positive behavior in the workplace, and was considering asking one of the employees to promote that behavior, it would likely be unwise to ask someone who was undesirable (e.g., someone who was universally identified by their colleagues as a bully) to promote that behavior.",associating undesirable discredit guilt association refer attempt claim person idea,"['association', 'baseless', 'discredit', 'guilt', 'intimidate', 'mislead', 'misrepresent', 'smear', 'subjective', 'undesirable', 'unethical']"
Halo Effect,Desires,"The Halo Effect refers to the phenomenon whereby someone's perception of a person's (or company's/product's) trait(s) is positively influenced by their positive evaluation of other trait(s) belonging to the same person (or company/product). This effect could encourage people to imagine themselves as an all-round better person if they engage in a specific positive behavior change, which might increase the desirability of the behavior and the likelihood of setting and acting on intentions to start the behavior. It might also make them more likely to continue the behavior in the longer-term. In such cases, it might not need to be rectified. However, if there are other situations where the halo effect is having counterproductive impacts (e.g., if someone assumes that someone who is attractive, svelte and articulate is therefore an accurate/knowledgeable/honest source of nutritional information, then they might believe that person, even if they are telling them to do something that would be counterproductive), then in those cases it would be particularly important to identify when this effect is occurring, and to actively search for other sources of information in order to form more accurate beliefs about the behavior in question.",halo trait company's positively influenced whereby belonging person's evaluation someone's,"['attitudes', 'aura', 'characteristics', 'genes', 'halo', 'perception', 'perceptions', 'positive', 'qualities', 'stereotype', 'trait', 'traits', 'transitive']"

This bias might be something to take into account if someone wishes to increase the degree to which the physical environment facilitates a desirable behavior. By placing objects and/or reminders where people are more likely to see and to prefer them, this could increase the probability that the behavior in question is thought about in the first place, and the probability that it is remembered and chosen at moments of behavioral opportunity.",right-handed handedness right-hand dominant qualities person's tendency attribute bias refers,"['attributes', 'body', 'characteristics', 'dominance', 'dominant', 'hand', 'mentality', 'preference', 'preferences', 'qualities', 'side', 'superiority', 'trait']"

In cases where this bias is encouraging a positive behavior, or if it is discouraging a negative behavior, this may not need to be rectified. In cases where this bias is counterproductive, a benevolent helper could point out when it is occurring, or could attempt to reduce the chance that it happens in the future by encouraging people to keep a diary documenting their predictions of different outcomes over time (so that they can return to previous entries to remind themselves of what they actually predicted). This may be particularly important to ensure the Maintains condition continues to be met (otherwise the person may be at risk of becoming demotivated, if they believe that they should have known all along that they would fail). Additionally, if a person believes that they ""knew all along"" that a particular behavior was a good idea or that it could be implemented in a certain way, this might cause them to feel more ownership of the behavioral change idea than they otherwise would, which might increase their desire for and motivation to plan for, remember, and engage in the behavior.",referes hindsight predictable perceive tendency bias events took past place,"['ascribe', 'beholder', 'construed', 'extrapolate', 'generalize', 'hindsight', 'misunderstand', 'past', 'perceive', 'predictable', 'remember', 'retrospect', 'subjective']"
Historian's Fallacy,Maintains,"Historian's Fallacy refers to the fallacious assumption that historical decision-makers had the same information available to them, and viewed events from the same perspective, as the people who later analyze their decisions. This fallacy (or one very similar to it) might come into play if someone is utilising a behavior change diary (or similar method of keeping track of their behavior change goals and their progress towards them). When reviewing their past plans, they might be more likely to conclude that their past self should have known certain things about how the behavioral change plans would work out. To counteract this, it could be helpful for the person to record not only their goals and progress towards them, but their reasons for setting specific goals and for making plans to meet them in the ways that they did; that way, when they later look back on a specific plan, they might more easily identify the gaps in their knowledge that caused them to form plans in the way that they did.

Hostile Media Effect (Disconfirmation Bias),Considers,"The Hostile Media Effect refers to a form of Disconfirmation Bias, whereby people who hold more polarized political views are more likely to see a media report as being politically biased. This bias might be an important consideration when planning interventions that target populations who may have polarized political views. If the target population is likely to see a message of biased if presented in the media, then it might be preferable to find alternative ways to share information about the desired behavioral change (and its effects) with them. For example, one might want to share a pubic reminder of the importance of vaccinations. For some populations of people, sharing such a reminder via the media may be acceptable, while for other, more polarized/strongly-partisan subpopulations, it may be preferable to find alternative ways of engaging with them and of encouraging them to consider the advantages of vaccinations (e.g., such as by engaging with their social networks, finding people who are open to changing their mind, and then to discussing their belief updates with their peers).",polarized whereby politically hostile bias biased refers report media views,"['biased', 'confirmation', 'hostile', 'hostility', 'ideological', 'impartial', 'intolerant', 'media', 'partisan', 'polarized', 'politics', 'report', 'sectarian']"
Humor Effect in Memory,Remembers,"The Humor Effect in Memory refers to a tendency for humorous items to be more easily remembered than non-humorous ones. If someone remembers a behavioral change goal more easily due to humor, this could increase the probability that they think of it and choose to engage in it when opportunities to engage in that behavior arise. This may be an important consideration for implementation scientists at the ""considers"" stage, as well - for those planning interventions, it may be worth incorporating humor, especially if it is thought that this will increase the retention of the key messages being promoted (which might be expected to increase the probability that the person will remember and choose the behavior at the moment(s) of behavioral opportunity).",humorous remembered tendency humor refers items easily effect ones memory,"['comedy', 'comic', 'funny', 'humor', 'humorous', 'jokes', 'laugh', 'memory', 'remember', 'sarcasm', 'wit', 'witty']"

Illicit Major Fallacy,Desires,"The Illicit Major Fallacy is a logical reasoning fallacy about the relationships between categories or assertions. For the purpose of explaining this fallacy, let's imagine there are three categories of things, labeled as ""A,"" ""B,"" and ""C."" The Illicit Major Fallacy has the following form: ""All A are B. No C are A. Therefore, no C are B."" There is a fallacious assumption here that the third statement follows from the first two, but it does not (e.g., B could be a larger category than A, so just because no C are A, that doesn't preclude things in category C from belonging to category B). In cases where this fallacy is encouraging a positive behavior or discouraging a negative one, this may not need to be rectified. In cases where this fallacy is counterproductive, a benevolent helper could point out counterexamples to demonstrate that this is a fallacy. This fallacy could cause people to form unrealistic perceptions of the desirability of the behavior, of the range of plans that could feasibly allow them to enact it, of the effects of the behavior, and of the resource requirements for starting and continuing the behavior. For example, someone might reason that, ""over the past year, all people who've been physically active at the gym for at least 2-2.5 hours every week have been physically active for at least 2 hours every week. No non-gym members use the gym for that length of time every week. Therefore, no non-gym members have been physically active for at least 2 hours every week."" (The implication of this flawed reasoning might then be: ""if I want to be active for at least 2 hours every week, I can't remain a non-gym member. But due to my income, I have to remain a non-gym member, therefore I am incapable of setting the goal of being active for at least 2 hours every week."")

Illusion of Asymmetric Insight,Intends,"The Illusion of Asymmetric Insight refers to a person's perception that they know more about their peers than their peers know about them. The same term can also be applied when a group believes they know more about other groups than those groups know about them. This illusion might cause people to assume that they would be able to perceive others' internal struggles in starting and continuing a behavior. In turn, this could lead them to form inaccurate beliefs about how easy the behavior change is (which might be motivating in the short-term, but which might cause unrealistic plans to be made, which might reduce the chance of the behavior being successfully engaged in and maintained).

Illusion of Control,Desires,"The Illusion of Control refers to a tendency to overestimate the degree to which events fall within one's control. In cases where this illusion is encouraging a positive behavior or discouraging a negative one, this may not need to be rectified. In cases where this illusion is counterproductive, a benevolent helper could point out the other factors that can contribute to specific outcomes (beyond the factors within the person's control). This illusion might cause people to think that a given behavior change is more under their control than it is in reality, which could cause them to desire the behavior change more (""Desires"") or to believe that specific actions they take will lead to specific positive outcomes (""Believes""), as well as feeling more accomplished than they otherwise would in situations where they succeed at starting or continuing the behavior (which could be motivating). On the other hand, it could also cause people to feel that a failure to engage in or to continue a behavior is representative of a personal failure, which might be demotivating for them over the longer-term (""Maintains""). Focusing on factors over which they have control may also cause someone to overlook important environmental and social considerations (which might be important for meeting the ""Has"" condition) during the planning (""Intends""), implementation (""Chooses"") and maintenance stages of their behavior change. (There are some similarities between this illusion and self-serving bias. The Illusion of Control, however, differs with respect to how people respond to failure, so it presents different obstacles to behavioral change compared to self-serving bias.)

Illusion of Transparency,Has,"Illusion of Transparency refers to a tendency for people to overestimate how transparent their mental state is (that is, how easily others can discern their personal mental state). Relatedly, an Observer's Illusion of Transparency refers to a tendency for people to overestimate the transparency of the mental states of those they are observing (causing them to overestimate the degree to which they can discern others' mental states). This tendency might cause people to assume that everyone around them knows their mental state, and possibly (by extension) how best to support them in their behavior change efforts. For example, someone might assume that their peers know it is distressing them when they offer them a cigarette at a party when they are trying to quit (despite not necessarily having told them about their quitting intentions and how much they matter to them). A benevolent helper could encourage someone to avoid making such assumptions, and to instead voice their needs and emotions whenever this would be helpful (especially in supporting their behavior change efforts). Another example would be emphasizing the importance of asking for help/resources when they are needed, and/or asking for permission to do whatever behavior would be beneficial, rather than assuming that others around the person already know that they have specific needs. For example, someone who struggles to work productively in the morning might benefit from asking their supervisor if they can start at a later time (rather than assuming their supervisor will know their needs), if they are in a workplace where they know that the starting times are negotiable between employees and their supervisors.",overestimate observer's transparency discern others' illusion transparent observing tendency refers,"['democratic', 'illusion', 'illusions', 'impartial', 'mental', 'objectivity', 'observe', 'parallax', 'rationality', 'subjective', 'transparent']"
Illusion-of-truth Memory Bias,Desires,"Illusion-of-truth Memory Bias refers to a phenomenon whereby people are more likely to identify statements as true if they have previously heard them (even if they cannot consciously remember having heard them), regardless of the actual validity of the statement. In other words, Illusion-of-truth Memory Bias causes people to be more likely to believe a familiar statement than an unfamiliar one. This may be important for those planning interventions to raise awareness of a particular desired behavior. This bias might mean that it is less advisable to present myths and myth-busters, if there is a chance that people will remember the myth as true (merely due to having been exposed to it). The same bias may increase the importance of communication and repetition as part of interventions that encourage people to adopt a specific behavior - if people have heard before that a behavior will be associated with positive outcomes, this might increase their probability of believing this, and of planning for and choosing the behavior.",consciously unfamiliar whereby validity bias phenomenon refers identify previously regardless,"['axiom', 'delusion', 'falsehood', 'illusion', 'illusions', 'memory', 'mirage', 'myth', 'remember', 'statement', 'truth', 'truths']"
Illusory Correlation,Desires,"Illusory Correlation refers to a phenomenon whereby an observer sees a relationship they expected to see between variables in a dataset, even when no such relationship exists. In some situations, this bias might increase the probability of someone engaging in a desired behavior - for example, someone might be more likely to see a relationship between a behavior and an outcome, a level of effort and the level of successful engagement in the behavior, and so on, if they expect such relationships to exist; this in itself may be motivating, and may increase the probability that the person values, desires, and attempts to start and maintain the behavior. In cases where this bias is counterproductive, however, it may be helpful to encourage the person to at least question their assumptions about the situation in question, and (ideally) to seek more information (where available) in order to form more accurate beliefs.",dataset illusory whereby correlation phenomenon observer variables sees refers relationship,"['correlate', 'correlated', 'correlation', 'data', 'histogram', 'illusion', 'linkage', 'predictive', 'relationship', 'relationships', 'subjective', 'variable']"
Impact Bias,Desires,"Impact Bias refers to a tendency to overestimate the length or the intensity of the impact of future emotions.

Incomplete Comparison Fallacy,Desires,"Incomplete Comparison Fallacy refers to the use of a claim containing incomplete information, which therefore cannot be refuted. This fallacy would be important to avoid when presenting information about why it may be beneficial to engage in a desired behavior. Although it might increase the probability that someone desires, plans for, implements and maintains a positive behavior, it would be scientifically misleading, unethical, and would come with the potential to backfire for those who notice the fallacy (through Argument from Fallacy/Inoculation Effect).",refuted incomplete refers fallacy comparison containing therefore claim cannot information,"['comparison', 'contradict', 'disprove', 'inaccuracies', 'inaccurate', 'incomplete', 'information', 'misrepresent', 'refute', 'subjective', 'substantiate', 'untrue']"
Inconsistent Comparison Fallacy,Desires,"Inconsistent Comparison Fallacy refers to the comparison of items along differing dimensions in such a way as to give the impression that one item is superior to the others. This fallacy would be important to avoid when presenting information about why it may be beneficial to engage in a desired behavior. Although it might increase the probability that someone desires, plans for, implements and maintains a positive behavior, it could be misleading (and if so, unethical), and would come with the potential to backfire for those who notice the fallacy (through Argument from Fallacy/Inoculation Effect).",differing dimensions inconsistent refers fallacy superior impression item items comparison,"['comparison', 'comparisons', 'credence', 'dimension', 'impression', 'inconsistent', 'inferior', 'resemblance', 'subjective', 'superior']"
Information Bias,Desires,"Information Bias in psychology refers to a cognitive bias towards seeking further information, even when further information is not relevant or required for choosing one's next course of action. If people keep asking for more information than is necessary for them to adopt the new behavior, gently point out to them that they have all the necessary information and that they may just be trying to find ways to avoid adopting the new behavior.",cognitive choosing bias refers seeking psychology one's relevant towards action,"['choice', 'choices', 'consult', 'decision', 'decisions', 'further', 'information', 'more', 'notify', 'pursue', 'relevant', 'seek', 'subjective']"
Ingroup Bias,Desires,"Ingroup Bias refers to a tendency for people to give preferential treatment those perceived to be members of their ingroup. It might be that this bias encourages positive behavior change, if the people and/or organizations presenting information about a behavior are perceived as members of the ingroup. This bias may also increase someone's motivation to start and continue a behavior, if they perceive it as being a requirement for belonging to a desired ingroup. On the other hand, there are also cases where this fallacy may be counterproductive (such as when a behavior is seen as putting the person at risk of differing too much from what they perceive as the ingroup norm), a benevolent helper could point out that this is an undesirable bias that has multiple negative impacts (including in other areas of life), and could encourage the person to focus on the behavior itself, rather than the people or organization(s) they associate (or don't associate) with it. (There are some similarities between these strategies and those targeting Guilt by Association and Appeal to Spite fallacy, except that those focus on the outgroup.)

Inoculation Effect,Desires,"The Inoculation Effect refers to the phenomenon whereby exposure to a flawed argument in favor of a particuar hypothesis then reduces the perceived credibility of the hypothesis itself (despite the possibility that the hypothesis could be supported by other, better arguments). (Note: similar to Argument from Fallacy.) It might be possible to reduce the probability of this effect arising, if care is taken not to promote a positive behavior (or discourage a negative one) in a way that employs bad arguments. If the effect has already occurred, though, then in cases where the end result is people being encouraged to engage in a positive behavior or being discouraged from a negative behavior, it may not need to be rectified. And in cases where this effect is counterproductive, a benevolent helper could point out that the hypothesis should be evaluated separately from the arguments that had been proposed to support it, and could encourage the person to steelman the hypothesis and/or to focus on the information itself, rather than the flawed ways in which it has so far been conveyed.

Irrational Escalation (aka Escalation of Commitment) / Sunk Cost Fallacy,Desires,"Irrational Escalation refers to a phenomenon whereby people justify increased investment in a decision based on the cumulative prior investment, despite new evidence suggesting that the cost (starting today) of continuing the decision increasingly outweighs the expected benefit. Help people to notice that having sunk a lot of time, energy, and money into an old behavior isn't a good reason to maintain that old behavior. Conversely, ask people to expend a lot of time, energy, and money on a new, positive behavior, since that will decrease the likelihood that they'll regress into other, less desirable behaviors.",cumulative outweighs escalation increasingly whereby investment irrational suggesting phenomenon refers,"['cost', 'decline', 'decrease', 'decreased', 'escalation', 'increase', 'increased', 'increases', 'investment', 'previous', 'prior', 'pulldown', 'risen', 'sank', 'sunk']"
Irrelevant Conclusion Fallacy,Desires,"The Irrelevant Conclusion Fallacy refers to the use of an argument that may in itself be valid, but that does not address the issue in question. This fallacy would be important to avoid if someone is attempting to support someone throughout any of the processes of behavior change (from deciding whether they want to engage in a behavior, to planning how they will engage in it, and/or through to deciding if they will do it and stick to it). If someone employs this fallacy when trying to support someone to plan, engage in and continue a behavior, then when challenges arise, they may fail to address the person's actual concerns, which may reduce the effectiveness of the support they are offering. This could also be directly demotivating, if it makes the person attempting to engage in the behavior feel that their needs are not being heard or supported. If someone employs this fallacy when addressing someone's questions regarding the impacts of the behavior in question, this could be similarly demotivating, or could even lead the person to not believe that the behavior will have the purported effects, because they feel as if their questions have not been adequately answered.",refers fallacy irrelevant conclusion valid argument itself issue address question,"['address', 'arguement', 'argument', 'arguments', 'assertion', 'conclusion', 'conclusions', 'inference', 'irrelevant', 'issue', 'moot', 'subjective', 'valud']"
Just-world Phenomenon,Desires,"The Just-world Phenomenon refers to a tendency for people to want to believe that the world is fundamentally just. As a result, when they witness an otherwise inexplicable injustice, they may rationalize it by searching for ways in which the victim can be perceived as deserving it. This phenomenon could be motivating in situations where the person has successfully started or is beginning to maintain a behavior, because they may perceive that success as being entirely earned (rather than also being the product of luck and circumstances). Conversely, it could be demotivating in cases where someone has failed an initial attempt at behavior change, or has had a slip during the maintenance phase. In those cases, it may be helpful to discourage people from assigning blame, or to point out examples of times when they have succeeded. ",inexplicable rationalize deserving injustice fundamentally perceived tendency victim phenomenon refers,"['beholder', 'dignity', 'equality', 'fairness', 'fundamental', 'intrinsic', 'irrationality', 'justice', 'morality', 'rationality', 'rationalize', 'subjective', 'victim', 'world']"
Loaded Question Fallacy,Considers,"Loaded Question Fallacy refers to the use (typically in an argument) of a question which contains a controversial assumption (such as a presumption of guilt). This fallacy would be important to avoid when presenting information about why it may be beneficial to engage in a desired behavior. Even if it increase the probability that someone engaged in the behavior, statements based on an unproven assumptions would be unwise (and arguably unethical, if provably false or if inducing unwarranted guilt on the part of the listener) to employ as a means of promoting behavior change.",presumption controversial guilt refers fallacy typically assumption loaded contains argument,"['assumption', 'assumptions', 'contentious', 'controversial', 'controversy', 'debatable', 'loaded', 'question', 'reloaded', 'subjective']"
Loss Aversion (see Endowment Effect),Chooses,"Loss Aversion refers to people's tendency to strongly prefer avoiding losses to acquiring gains.

Ludic Fallacy,Desires,"Ludic Fallacy can refer to the fallacious assumption that one's own model (or view) of something captures all relevant aspects, and all risks associated with it (that is, that there are no unknown unknowns). (Note: the strategies for the Ludic Fallacy are similar to those for Hasty Generalizations.) The Ludic Fallacy could cause people to prematurely stop searching for information about how to complete the behavior (thus affecting the degree to which they meet the ""Knows"" condition), and/or could cause them to prematurely stop searching for ways to make their environment more conducive to their desired behavior(s), because they conclude that they know everything there is to know about the situation. They may believe, for example, that it is impossible to improve the environmental conditions (e.g., such that the environment would increase their success in starting and continuing the behavior). The same fallacy may also cause someone to assume that they should give up trying or maintaining the behavior for other reasons, and to be too sure about this conclusion (without acknowledging key uncertainties). A longer-term solution to this tendency might be to encourage the person to practice probabilistic thinking, with particular attention being paid to estimating their level of uncertainty in every belief that they form. (For example, they could note that, although they can be sure that they are currently having thoughts [if they are thinking about this idea, then they must be thinking], this is probably the only thing they can really be sure about, and beyond that, that there is some degree of uncertainty in almost every statement). They could also practice fostering epistemic humility - to do this, they could practice realizing that they may be wrong, and practice subjecting their own and others' statements/beliefs to scrutiny using evidence and reasoning.",captures unknowns fallacious risks fallacy aspects associated assumption unknown one's,"['differs', 'insight', 'known', 'mindset', 'model', 'perspective', 'perspectives', 'self', 'standpoint', 'subjective', 'unknown', 'view', 'viewpoint']"

Misleading Vividness Fallacy,Desires,"Misleading Vividness Fallacy refers to the fallacious assumption that more vividly-described examples of something are more likely to be representative of that thing, or more worthwhile to consider when deciding on a conclusion or course of action. At least in its misleading form, this fallacy would be important to avoid when presenting information about why it may be beneficial to engage in a desired behavior. Arguably, if there were examples that were both vivid and true, then this might be beneficial to include as part of one's communication about a desired behavior change (as it might increase the degree to which people desire, plan for, implement and maintain the behavior).",fallacious misleading deciding worthwhile representative refers fallacy assumption conclusion examples,"['deceive', 'description', 'discredit', 'distort', 'mislead', 'misleading', 'misled', 'misrepresent', 'representative', 'subjective', 'truthful', 'vivid', 'worthwhile']"
Money Illusion,Desires,"The Money Illusion refers to a tendency to concentrate on the nominal (face) value of money rather than its value in terms of purchasing power. This might affect the degree to which someone desires a given behavior - for example, if the behavior is perceived as increasing earning capacity (such as through building a new habit or skill), then this may be perceived as more motivating than if the behavior is perceived as changing the person's purchasing power. Likewise, someone may dislike the idea of parting with money directly (even if it would be through a tax-deductible donation, which might not reduce their purchasing power much over the long-term if they receive tax benefits from it). To compensate for this effect in cases where this is desirable, e.g., when asking people to donate to a charity, show them how large of an effect their donation will have.",illusion tendency nominal concentrate purchasing refers terms face value money,"['actual', 'apparent', 'delusion', 'emphasis', 'focus', 'illusion', 'illusions', 'invisible', 'mirage', 'money', 'obfuscate', 'perception', 'power', 'purchase', 'subjective']"
Mood-congruent Memory Bias,Remembers,"The Mood-congruent Memory bias refers to the improved recall of information that is congruent with one's current mood. If someone remembers a behavioral change goal more easily due to the information being presented at a time when it is congruent with their mood, this could increase the probability that they think of it and choose to engage in it when opportunities to engage in that behavior arise. This may be an important consideration for implementation scientists at the ""considers"" stage: for those planning interventions, it may be worth planning when and how to best present information (in such a way as to increase the probability that the information will be congruent with the mood of the perceiver), especially if it is thought that this will increase the retention of the key messages being promoted (which might be expected to increase the probability that the person will remember and choose the behavior at the moment(s) of behavioral opportunity).",congruent mood bias refers improved one's recall current memory information,"['attitudes', 'congruent', 'correlated', 'current', 'feelings', 'memory', 'mindset', 'mood', 'remember', 'sentiments', 'subjective', 'tone']"

Moral Luck,Maintains,"Moral Luck refers to a situation in which moral (dis)value is ascribed to an action or event based on its outcome, rather than on the intention(s) or actual level of responsibility of the moral agents involved at the time of the action or event. [note to self - need to come back and rephrase this] In cases where this phenomenon is encouraging a positive behavior or discouraging a negative one, this may not need to be rectified. In cases where this phenomenon is counterproductive, a benevolent helper could point out the factors in a situation that could have turn out differently (particularly with respect to the moral implications of the different possible outcomes). This phenomenon might cause people to think that a given behavior change is morally praiseworthy if it is associated with positive outcomes, even if those outcomes were in part due to change. The reverse could also occur (moral culpability may be ascribed to the behavior change if it is associated with negative outcomes, even if these were not due to the behavior itself).

Moving the Goalposts Fallacy,Desires,"Moving the Goalposts Fallacy refers to the dismissal of a valid response to a claim in an argument, followed by the demand for other (usually more difficult-to-produce) evidence. If this fallacy was preventing someone from engaging with arguments pertaining to the possibility of, or positive outcomes associated with, a behavior change, then a benevolent helper could encourage the person to write down, a priori, what information would cause them to change their mind regarding the issue in question. If the person was able to be specific about their hypotheses and about what level of evidence would cause them to change their mind, they might be less likely to ""move the goalposts"" (or might be more likely to at least acknowledge the times at which they do so).

Negativity Bias,Desires,"Negativity Bias refers to a cognitive bias in which people pay more attention to and give more weight negative experiences or information than to positive or neutral experiences or information.

Neglect of Probability,Considers,"Neglect of Probability refers to a tendency to completely disregard probabilities when making a decision under uncertainty.

Next-in-line Effect in Memory,Remembers,"The Next-in-line Effect refers to a tendency for someone in a group to be less likely to remember what was said immediately before or after it was their turn to speak. This effect may be an argument against using group discussion settings as the first context in which to present information pertaining to a desired behavior change: in group discussion settings, depending on how they are set out, it would be possible that a number of people in the room would be considering whether they might be speaking next, in which case they may not recall the information pertaining to the behavior. This could then reduce the probability that they think of the behavior and choose to engage in it when opportunities to engage in that behavior arise.

Nirvana Fallacy,Desires,"The Nirvana Fallacy refers to a tendency to assume that perfect solutions to problems exist, or to compare reality with unrealistic, idealized alternatives. The Nirvana Fallacy could cause people to dismiss proposals for behavior change, if these do not match up with their unrealistically high expectations regarding what a behavior change ""should"" constitute. It may also distort their perception of the possible ways to plan for and implement the behavior, may give them unrealistically high expectations of the environmental requirements (""Has"" condition), and may give them unrealistically high expectations regarding what should happen during the maintenance phase of the behavior as well. A benevolent helper could respectfully encourage the person to engage in more realistic reasoning, perhaps by providing examples of outcomes that are desirable, despite not being perfect.",idealized nirvana unrealistic tendency refers fallacy alternatives solutions compare perfect,"['alternatives', 'bliss', 'ideal', 'impractical', 'mirage', 'nirvana', 'optimal', 'oxymoron', 'paradise', 'perfect', 'unrealistic', 'utopia', 'utopian']"
No True Scotsman Fallacy,Has,"The No True Scotsman Fallacy refers to the fallacious assumption that one can still defend a universal claim even when faced with a counterexample of it, as long as one simply redefines the universal claim as specifically excluding that counterexample. This fallacy may cause someone to form unrealistic beliefs about what is involved in successfully adopting and/or continuing a behavior. For example, if they believe that all people who learn a particular skill must do so through a specific school or training program in order to be considered ""truly"" skilled at the behavior in question, then - even if they are given counterexamples of people who learned the skill through other mechanisms - they may form the mistaken belief that they will not be ""truly"" skilled at the behavior unless they too partake in exactly the same training. This might present them with an unnecessarily inflexible/restrictive idea of what would be required to be able to engage in the behavior (i.e. to meet the ""Has"" condition), which might then limit how realistic or successful they might be in their plans to start and continue the behavior. In such cases, it would be helpful if it was possible to encourage the person to consider re-evaluating the situation in light of new information. Over the longer-term, it might help to encourage the person to develop probabilistic and nuanced thinking, wherein they might become less inclined to want to categorize things as being ""always"" a certain way.",fallacious counterexample excluding faced refers fallacy universal defend assumption specifically,"['authenticity', 'citizenship', 'creed', 'equality', 'group', 'identifier', 'identities', 'identity', 'member', 'nationality', 'password', 'true', 'universal']"
Normalcy Bias,Considers,"Normalcy Bias refers to a cognitive bias whereby people facing a disaster or other threat tend to underestimate both the possibility of the disaster or threat occurring, and its possible effects. An assumption is made in the case of the Normalcy Bias that since a disaster never has occurred, it never will occur. It also results in a person's inability to cope with a disaster once it does occur. People with a normalcy bias have difficulties reacting to something they have not experienced before. People also tend to interpret warnings in the most optimistic way possible, seizing on any ambiguities to infer a less serious situation. The normalcy bias often results in unnecessary deaths in disaster situations. Provide regular training for governments, communities, and individuals so that disaster responses become automatic.",ambiguities seizing reacting cognitive occurring underestimate optimistic infer cope whereby,"['disaster', 'disasters', 'estimate', 'estimates', 'estimating', 'forecast', 'normal', 'normalcy', 'predict', 'quake', 'threat', 'underestimate']"
Observer-Expectancy Effect,Desires,"The Observer-Expectancy Effect refers to an effect whereby someone expects a particular result (e.g., in an experiment or dataset) and, owing to this expectation, subconsciously manipulates an experiment or misinterprets data in order to find that result. This might manifest in a behavior change context as a person who has an expectation that they'll fail to adopt a new behavior and who thus subconsciously sabotages themselves or misinterprets the actual outcomes as failure. When this has already occurred, it might be helpful to challenge people's assumptions or to encourage people to write down or speak through exactly what they did and what outcomes occurred, since it may be easier to analyze what happened and to identify flawed reasoning when it is articulated clearly. In other cases, it might be possible to avoid this occurring in the first place, or to encourage people to expect better outcomes (thus hopefully increasing their chances of succeeding in their behavior change efforts). In such situations, this could interact positively with Optimism Bias. As long as the person being encouraged is aware of the Observer-expectancy Effect and of the placebo effect (and is therefore not being misled as to the intentions behind such encouragement), it might be helpful to encourage the person to be slightly more optimistic than is statistically justified. As long as the person's expectations are not so high as to be unrealistic, having high expectations in and of themselves could increase the probability that the person performs better than they would have (had their expectations been lower). This effect could interact with every stage of behavior change, from the planning through to implementation and maintenance of the behavior.",dataset owing manipulates expectation whereby expects refers experiment result effect,"['data', 'decipher', 'discern', 'expect', 'experiment', 'extrapolate', 'interpret', 'manipulate', 'neural', 'observe', 'parse', 'result', 'subconscious', 'subjective', 'subvert', 'visualize']"
Omission Bias,Desires,"Omission Bias refers to a tendency to judge harmful actions as morally worse than equally harmful omissions (inactions). Some moral philosophers posit that this is not a bias and that it truly is the case that harmful actions are morally worse than harmful omissions (i.e., they endorse the acts/omissions distinction).

Ostrich Effect,Desires,"The Ostrich Effect refers to a tendency of investors to avoid undesirable information about their investments, for example, by checking the value of their investments less frequently during times that they know they won't like what they find. A saying related to this is phenomenon (also based on the popular myth that an ostrich buries its head in the sand) is to ""put one's head in the sand."" Remind people that knowing is virtually always better than not knowing, and that it's not possible to avoid or diagnose or respond to risky or negative situations simply by ignoring them. Encourage them to seek help or advice from a trusted third party, one who can be objective and unemotional about the situation. (For example, people may ignore symptoms of medical problems because knowing what's wrong makes it ""real.""

Out-Group Homogeneity Bias,Desires,"Out-Group Homogeneity Bias refers to the perception that outgroup members are more similar to one another (or homogeneous) compared to ingroup members (who are seen as more heterogeneous). It might be that this bias encourages positive behavior change, if the behavior change is perceived as being associated with the ingroup, and if that causes someone to think that there are many diverse methods of achieving the behavior change (because this thinking may encourage them to consider and plan for the ways in which the behavior change could relate to their unique circumstances, values and characteristics). On the other hand, if the behavior change is perceived as being associated with an outgroup, then it may be perceived as a more standardized activity that a homogeneous group of people adopts without variation, potentially also with very specific conditions required before being perceived as meeting the ""Has"" condition). A benevolent helper could point out that outgroup biases are undesirable for multiple reasons, and could encourage the person to focus on the behavior itself, rather than the people or organization(s) they associate (or don't associate) with it.

Overconfidence Effect,Intends,"The Overconfidence Effect refers to the cognitive bias of whereby someone's confidence in their answers to questions exceeds their level of accuracy. In cases where this effect is encouraging a positive behavior or discouraging a negative one, this may not need to be rectified. In cases where this fallacy is counterproductive, a benevolent helper could point out this effect and/or point out examples of ways in which it might apply. For example, if someone was assuming that they already know enough information to be able to perform a complex new behavior, it might help to point out to them that people with less knowledge of an area are less equipped to assess their own skill level in that area and less equipped to understand the relative difficulty of that behavior (which can also contribute to the Planning Fallacy). If the person is equipped with this knowledge and takes it into consideration, this may enable them to set more realistic expectations and goals, which might increase the chance that they remain motivated to continue improving their skills over time and to maintain the behavior over time. If the person is excessively confident in the accuracy of their beliefs, a longer-term solution might be to encourage them to practice probabilistic thinking and epistemic/intellectual humility (i.e. encourage them to realise that nothing is certain and that their beliefs could always turn out to be inaccurate).",overconfidence cognitive exceeds whereby confidence someone's bias refers accuracy answers,"['accuracy', 'arrogance', 'confidence', 'consistency', 'credibility', 'gullibility', 'humility', 'ignorance', 'infallibility', 'knowledge', 'objectivity', 'overconfidence']"
"Overvaluing Short-term Benefits compared to Long-term Benefits, or Temporal Discounting (see Hyperbolic Discounting)",Desires,"Temporal Discounting is a phenomenon similar to Hyperbolic Discounting, in that subjects prefer benefits or rewards sooner rather than later. This may lead to Dynamic Inconsistency (which refers to the inconsistency between a decision-maker's preferences over current versus future choices). (Similar strategies should be useful in this context as those applied in the case of hyperbolic discounting.) This tendency may make it more difficult to convince people to value behavior changes that will lead to longer-term (as opposed to shorter-term) benefits, which may need to be taken into consideration at the intervention planning stage (because it might imply that different approaches should be taken to promoting awareness of the behavior and its expected outcomes). Temporal discounting could alter the relative attractiveness and desirability of the behavior, the steps involved in implementing and maintaining it it, as well as its valuation in relation to the alternative options.",discounting hyperbolic inconsistency rewards temporal preferences sooner phenomenon subjects versus,"['benefit', 'better', 'deserve', 'future', 'incentive', 'later', 'reap', 'reward', 'rewards', 'smarter', 'someday', 'sooner', 'time']"
Pareidolia,Desires,"Pareidolia refers to a phenomenon whereby vague and/or random stimuli are perceived as significant. This may be important for people who are planning interventions designed to raise awareness of a particular desired behavior. This phenomenon might mean that the timing or manner in which the behavior is promoted could be interpreted as significant or meaningful, even if the interventions designers didn't intend for such meanings to be derived from it. For example, this might be an argument against choosing a national day of mourning as a day to launch a behavior change or awareness campaign, or choosing a web address (e.g., as a contact address for people a behavior change app) that could be perceived as holding a special significance, particularly if the connotations are negative (e.g., including ""666,"" which might be interpreted negatively by some people). The same phenomenon could also be helpful in promoting behavior change, if people perceive the behavior change (or the communication associated with it) to be linked to something that is both positive and significant for them.",stimuli whereby perceived vague phenomenon refers random significant as are,"['cognitive', 'cortex', 'glutamate', 'neural', 'neuron', 'neurons', 'pareidolia', 'random', 'sensory', 'significant', 'stimuli', 'subjective', 'synapse', 'vague']"
Part-Set Cueing Effect in Memory,Remembers,"The Part-Set Cueing Effect in memory refers to the phenomenon whereby the presentation of a subset of previously learned items as retrieval ""cues"" can impair recall for the remaining information. However, presentation of a subset differs from *relearning* a subset, which (in contrast) appears able to improve recall of the non-relearned associations. This effect may be important for people who are planning interventions designed to remind people of a particular desired behavior (or of the steps required to start, or to maintain, the behavior). When reminding people of information that has been previously learned and then partly forgotten, it may be preferable to prompt people to remember a specific behavior change (or a specific action that will help them in meeting their behavior change goal) by allowing them to actively relearn part of the information, rather than by simply re-presenting them with part of the information.",cues relearning impair retrieval associations differs whereby subset presentation phenomenon,"['cadence', 'cue', 'inspiration', 'lesson', 'memories', 'memory', 'part', 'remember', 'remembering', 'reminder', 'rewind', 'set']"
Perfectionist Fallacy,Intends,"Perfectionist Fallacy refers to the fallacious assumption that the only permissible option is perfection, and anything less than that should be rejected. (Similar strategies could be useful for this fallacy as for the Nirvana Fallacy.) This fallacy could cause people to dismiss proposals for behavior change, if these do not match up with their unrealistically perfectionistic expectations regarding what a behavior change ""should"" constitute. It may also distort their perception of the possible ways to plan for and implement the behavior, may give them unrealistically high expectations of the environmental requirements (""Has"" condition), and may give them unrealistically high expectations regarding what should happen during the maintenance phase of the behavior. A benevolent helper could respectfully encourage the person to engage in more realistic reasoning, perhaps by providing examples of outcomes that are desirable, despite not being perfect.",perfectionist permissible perfection fallacious refers fallacy rejected assumption option less,"['compulsive', 'dieter', 'genius', 'ideal', 'immaculate', 'instinctive', 'perfection', 'perfectionist', 'picky', 'precision', 'reject', 'subjective', 'tolerances', 'workmanship']"
Planning Fallacy,Knows,"The Planning Fallacy is a tendency for people and organizations to underestimate how long they will need to complete a task, even when they have past experience of similar tasks taking longer than expected. The bias only appears to affect predictions about one's own tasks; when uninvolved observers predict task completion times, they appear to show a pessimistic bias, overestimating the time taken.

Precision/Accuracy Bias,Desires,"Precision/Accuracy Bias refers to a tendency to believe that numbers that are stated more precisely (e.g., 75.1259) are more accurate than numbers that are not (e.g., 75), despite the fact that higher levels of precision are only necessary, but not sufficient, for higher levels of accuracy. This phenomenon is something that should be taken into account when presenting information to people regarding a behavior change, the steps involved, or its consequences. In some situations, such as in meta-analyses of several large, well-designed studies, there might be enough information available to support the use of precise estimates (usually as part of confidence intervals, though, rather than point estimates), in which case it would be justified and advisable to do so. In cases where precise estimates are not possible (i.e. in most cases), it would could be potentially misleading to present numbers in a way that implies a number can be estimated with a higher degree of precision than is actually possible. In other cases, when the people receiving the information are sufficiently statistically literate, then instead of being convinced of a highly precise estimate, they may notice the use of excessively precise-seeming numbers, may decide that the information source is not credible, and may be less likely to follow any behavioral change advice imparted.",1259 tendency precision bias refers precisely accuracy levels sufficient accurate,"['accuracy', 'dpi', 'durability', 'number', 'precision', 'reliability', 'servo', 'spacing', 'throughput', 'torque', 'velocity']"
Primacy Effect,Remembers,"The Primacy Effect refers to a tendency to weigh or remember initial events or information more strongly than subsequent events or information. This may be important for people who are planning interventions designed to raise awareness of a particular desired behavior. Other things being equal, it may be helpful to prioritize presenting the most important information first, whenever the behavior change in question is being promoted. When planning and distributing informational materials to promote behavior change, the information that is most critical to the goal (e.g., encouraging people to desire or to adopt the behavior change) may be better to present at the start. This might mean that people are more likely to desire, remember, and choose to engage in and continue the behavior, when they encounter opportunities to do so. If the information presented also assists people in planning how exactly to start the behavior, then it could also help with the intention stage. (The recency effect could be another effect to consider at the same time as considering the primacy effect - in addition to presenting key information at the start, the recency effect suggests that it is important to present it at the end as well.)

Projection Bias,Desires,"Projection Bias refers to a phenomenon whereby a person subconsciously denies his or her own attributes, thoughts, and emotions, but ascribes these to people or events in the outside world. If this mechanism appears to be having a detrimental impact on someone's beliefs about a behavior change (or about what is required to enact or maintain it), then it might be worth encouraging the person to re-evaluate their beliefs about the behavior or situation. For example, a person might not want to attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meet-up because they feel that other attendees will judge them; on reflection, though, they might realise that their predictions about how others will perceive them has been influenced by the fact that they judge themselves harshly. By addressing their internal self-talk more directly, such as by seeking professional counselling, this might enable them to address any underlying faulty thought processes, which may also help them to update their beliefs about how others perceive them.

Prosecutor's Fallacy,Maintains,"Prosecutor's Fallacy refers to the use of fallacious statistical reasoning, usually in a legal contex, in which the specific way in which someone has been accused of something is falsely assumed to be irrelevant to judging how heavily to weigh evidence against them. Although this fallacy can refer to a legal phenomenon, the same fallacy could also affect statistical reasoning in other areas. In cases where it encourages a positive behavior or discourages a negative one, this fallacy may not need to be rectified. In other cases, it may help to encourage the person to draw a diagram or to sit down and calculate the actual probabilities of the outcomes that they are trying to estimate. For example, someone might hypothesize that they will fail at the behavior they are trying to start; if they then notice some evidence that they might indeed be struggling with the behavior, they might interpret that evidence as a demonstration that they will be one of the people who permanently fail in this particular behavior change goal, without realizing that the same evidence would also be present for people who go on to succeed at the behavior.

Pseudocertainty Effect,Desires,"The Pseudocertainty Effect refers to a tendency to perceive an outcome as certain despite uncertainty, in multi-stage decision-making. If this effect is increasing the degree to which people engage in positive behaviors, or decreasing their probability of engaging in negative ones, then it may not need to be rectified. In some cases, though, this effect could impede someone's ability to form realistic plans about how to start and maintain the behavior, or may cause them to overestimate future positive outcomes due to discarding/overlooking the uncertainty of reaching relevant milestones on the way to their behavior change goals. This effect may also be important for implementation scientists to take into consideration when planning how to best promote understanding of the behavior, its consequences, or the steps involved in enacting in it (both in the short- and longer-term).",decision-making uncertainty perceive tendency outcome refers despite effect certain an,"['cautious', 'certain', 'decision', 'decisions', 'depends', 'doubtful', 'optimistic', 'uncertain', 'uncertainty', 'unclear', 'unpredictable']"

Recency Effect,Remembers,"The Recency Effect refers to a tendency to weigh recent events more heavily than earlier events. This may be important for people who are planning interventions designed to raise awareness of a particular desired behavior. Other things being equal, the recency effect implies that it may be helpful to present key information last, whenever the behavior change in question is being promoted. When planning and distributing informational materials to promote behavior change, the information that is most critical to the goal (e.g., encouraging people to desire or to adopt the behavior change) could be presented last. This might mean that people are more likely to desire, remember, and choose to engage in and continue the behavior, when they encounter opportunities to do so.

Red Herring fallacy,Desires,"Red Herring Fallacy refers to the introduction of irrelevant material or information to an argument, usually with intent to distract from the main argument, and to lead towards a different conclusion. (Similar strategies may be useful in response to this fallacy as in response to the Irrelevant Conclusion fallacy.) This fallacy would be important to avoid if someone is attempting to support someone throughout any of the processes of behavior change (from deciding whether they want to engage in a behavior, to planning how they will engage in it, and/or through to deciding if they will do it and stick to it). If someone employs this fallacy when trying to support someone to plan, engage in and continue a behavior, then when challenges arise, they may fail to address the person's actual concerns, which may reduce the effectiveness of the support they are offering. This could also be directly demotivating, if it makes the person attempting to engage in the behavior feel that their needs are not being heard or supported. If someone employs this fallacy when addressing someone's questions regarding the impacts of the behavior in question, this could be similarly demotivating, or could even lead the person to not believe that the behavior will have the purported effects, because they feel as if their questions have not been adequately answered.",distract herring refers fallacy intent introduction irrelevant conclusion towards material,"['annoy', 'argument', 'confuse', 'discredit', 'distract', 'information', 'irrelevant', 'mislead', 'moot', 'obfuscate', 'relevant', 'subjective', 'unimportant']"

Retrospective Determinism Fallacy,Maintains,"Retrospective Determinism Fallacy refers to the fallacious assumption that something was always bound to happen, simply because it has now happened. In cases where this bias is encouraging a positive behavior, or if it is discouraging a negative behavior, this may not need to be rectified. In cases where this bias is counterproductive, a benevolent helper could point out when it is occurring, or could attempt to reduce the chance that it happens in the future by encouraging people to keep a diary documenting their predictions of different outcomes over time (so that they can return to previous entries to remind themselves that other outcomes were actually possible). This may be particularly important to ensure the Maintains condition continues to be met (otherwise the person may be at risk of becoming demotivated, if they believe that they were doomed to have a particular setback all along, or if they blame themselves for not predicting that).

Rosy Retrospection in Memory,Maintains,"Rosy Retrospection refers to a tendency for people to perceive past events more positively than they had perceived them at the time they originally experienced them. This appears to be more pronounced with moderately pleasant events (where minor annoyances and downsides appear to fade from memory more dramatically than positive aspects of events). (Similar to fading affect bias in memory. Note: merge/replace one with the other?) In cases where this bias is encouraging a positive behavior or if it is discouraging a negative behavior, this may not need to be rectified.

Self-Serving Bias,Has,"Self-Serving Bias refers to a cognitive bias whereby people tend to attribute their successes to internal or personal factors, but attribute their failures to situational factors beyond their control. In cases where this bias is encouraging a positive behavior or discouraging a negative one, this may not need to be rectified. In cases where this illusion is counterproductive, a benevolent helper could point out the other factors that can contribute to specific outcomes (beyond the factors within the person's control). This bias might cause people to think that a given behavior change is more under their control than it is in reality, which could cause them to desire the behavior change more (meeting the ""Desires"" condition) or to believe that specific actions they take will lead to specific positive outcomes (meeting the ""Believes"" condition), as well as feeling more accomplished than they otherwise would in situations where they succeed at starting or continuing the behavior (which could be motivating). On the other hand, this bias could also cause people to feel that a failure to engage in or to continue a behavior was less related to their own actions (or inactions) than it was in reality. This may lead them to overlook some of the ways in which their behavior could be optimized in the future, which might decrease their probability of successful behavior change over the longer-term. On the other hand, it may enable them to pay particular attention to ways in which the ""Has"" condition may not have been met, in cases where they have come up against a behavioral setback. (There are some similarities between this bias and the Illusion of Control. Self-serving bias, however, differs in how people respond to failure, so it presents different obstacles to behavioral change compared to the Illusion of Control.)

Slippery Slope Argument,Maintains ,"Slippery Slope Arguments are based on the idea that a (relatively small) first step will lead to a chain of related, more significant (and usually negative) events. This fallacy may encourage people to engage in or to continue positive behaviors (e.g., if they strictly avoid slip-ups because they believe this might lead to a long-term failure of behavioral maintenance), or might encourage people to avoid even one-off instances of negative behaviors (e.g., if they believed that this could lead to a habit of the negative behavior(s)). In such cases, it may not need to be rectified. In cases where this argument is counterproductive, it may help to point out that it is being employed, and to offer alternative ways of thinking about the situation in question. If taken to the extreme, the slippery slope argument may predispose someone to [all-or-nothing thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_distortion#All-or-nothing_thinking) and/or with [catastrophizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exaggeration#Cognitive_distortions), in which case it might be beneficial to use similar strategies to address it, such as challenging the flawed belief with more accurate information, or encouraging the person to seek professional help, especially if the reasoning is having a detrimental impact on their life.

Spotlight Fallacy,Desires,"The Spotlight Fallacy refers to the fallacious assumption that most members or cases of a certain class or type are similar to those that receive the most attention (for example, via media coverage). (Similar strategies could be useful for the Spotlight Fallacy as for hasty generalizations.) In some cases, the Spotlight Fallacy may encourage someone to desire and plan to engage in a behavior (e.g., focusing on a positive anecdote), which might seem beneficial. However, the same fallacy could also cause people to prematurely stop searching for information about how to complete the behavior (thus affecting the degree to which they meet the ""Knows"" condition), and/or could cause them to prematurely stop searching for ways to make their environment more conducive to their desired behavior(s), because they conclude (just based on information that captures their attention) that it is impossible to improve the environmental conditions (e.g., such that the environment would increase their success in starting and continuing the behavior). The fallacy may also cause someone to assume that they should give up trying or maintaining the behavior for other reasons (e.g., due to short-term setbacks, or due to prominent examples of behavior being portrayed as impossible or infeasible in the media). A longer-term solution to this tendency might be to encourage the person to practice probabilistic thinking, with particular attention being paid to estimating their level of uncertainty in every belief that they form. They could also practice fostering epistemic humility - they could practice realizing that they may be wrong, and practice subjecting their own and others' statements/beliefs to scrutiny using evidence and reasoning. As part of this, people could be encouraged to learn about the different levels of confidence that they can place in different levels of evidence (as part of this process, they could learn that anecdotal evidence is a lower level of evidence than randomized controlled trials, which are a lower level of evidence than systematic reviews and meta-analyses).",spotlight fallacious refers fallacy coverage assumption attention receive members media,"['attention', 'criticism', 'fame', 'focus', 'group', 'headlines', 'member', 'obscurity', 'praise', 'publicity', 'scorn', 'scrutiny', 'similar', 'spotlight']"

Stereotyping,Desires,"Stereotyping refers to the tendency to expect a member of a group to have certain characteristics, without having information about that individual (beyond the knowledge that they belong to that group). [to do - need to come back to this row to see if we should keep the below lines or not. looks like they were (at least in part) copied from wikipedia. Also perhaps too much detail for the ""description"" column?] The term ""stereotype"" derives from the Greek words στερεός (stereos), meaning ""firm, solid"", and τύπος (typos), meaning ""impression,"" hence: ""solid impression"". It was originally a term used in the world of printing to describe a duplicate impression of an original typographical element, used for printing instead of the original. There are many theories about why individuals tend to stereotype. One theory is that stereotyping is the most convenient way to sort information - grouping large numbers of people and experiences together. It could also be the case that one's childhood experiences are primary in the creation of stereotypes, and these stereotypes learned in childhood are self-perpetuating, growing stronger as an individual ages. A third theory focuses on an individual's need to feel good about him or herself. If I am part of Group A, and Group A is ""right"" about everything, then it is best for my self esteem to lump other individuals into separate, inferior groups. It might be that this bias encourages positive behavior change, if the people and/or organizations presenting information about a behavior are perceived as members of a group that they associate with positive stereotypes. This bias may also increase someone's motivation to start and continue a behavior, if they perceive it as being a requirement for belonging to a desired stereotyped group. On the other hand, there are also many cases where this fallacy may be counterproductive (such as when a behavior is seen as being associated with a stereotyped group that is perceived in a negative light), a benevolent helper could point out that this is an undesirable bias that has multiple negative impacts, and could encourage the person to focus on the behavior itself, rather than the people or organization(s) they associate (or don't associate) with it. (There are some similarities between these strategies and those targeting Guilt by Association and Appeal to Spite fallacy, except that those strategies focus on negative stereotypes, rather than the process of stereotyping in general.) In the longer-term, the general strategies that could be applied to hasty generalizations might also be helpful in addressing stereotyping. It could be especially helpful to encourage people to think in more nuanced ways about groups of people in the world. Practicing probabilistic thinking could be an important part of this, including developing an understanding about probability distributions. It may also be advisable to develop an understanding of the negative social impacts of stereotyping.

Straw Man Fallacy,Desires,"Straw Man Fallacy refers to the strategy of responding to a weak version of an opponent's position, that they don't actually believe, rather than responding to the opponent's original position (which may have been more difficult to refute). If this fallacy is encouraging a positive behavior or discouraging a negative one, it may not need to be addressed in the immediate future. In cases where the fallacy is counterproductive, the appropriate response might depend on how strongly the person holds their opposing beliefs. If they hold their beliefs strongly, then similar strategies might be useful as those for wishful thinking and the Appeal to Consequences fallacy. In cases where the backfire risk is deemed to be sufficiently low, it may be worth encouraging the person to practice actively considering the reasons that arguments in opposition to their own could actually turn out to be true. An example of this could be trying to find the best ways of supporting an opposing argument, which can be called ""steel-manning"" the argument ([Mattes, 2020](https://search.informit.com.au/fullText;dn=077923104428244;res=IELENG)). Even if the employment of the Straw Man Fallacy was not actively dissuading someone from positive behavior change in the present moment, it could be argued that it would be worth trying to reduce tendency in the longer-term. Practicing the active consideration (rather than dismissal) of alternative points of view can foster epistemic/intellectual humility (if the person develops a personal preference for actively considering alternative points of view), and this might be useful for addressing many of the other cognitive biases in this list. In addition to increasing the degree to which people engage with alternative points of view, intellectual humility has been associated with rising to challenges, and persisting after setbacks ([Porter et al. 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1041608020300686?casa_token=sJNl4ThLbWUAAAAA:E8U8KRkr11qvyWjYzRoIIiR8SaC_J2L9rML1N-a1qBt0CgNVIEPjWli410B7hb0ONUG7HtQ8x-8)), all of which could be useful for behavior change.

Subadditivity,Desires,"Subadditivity refers to the tendency to judge the probability of the whole to be less than the sum of the probabilities of the component parts. In cases where this tendency is encouraging a positive behavior or discouraging a negative one, this may not need to be rectified. In cases where this tendency is counterproductive, a benevolent helper could point out this fallacy and/or could encourage someone to systematically estimate the probabilities of important possible outcomes in ways that are less susceptible to subadditivity. For example, when a person is estimating the probability of positive outcomes from behavior change (e.g., when considering whether or how much they desire a behavior change), or when they are estimating the probability of failure (when deciding how to plan for success, and how to respond to failure when it does occur), then subadditivity may cause them to underestimate the overall probability of the outcome category (compared to if they added up the individual mutually exclusive events that together would form the overall category). So, rather than estimating the probability of the _overall_ categories of outcomes, it would be preferable to first estimate the probabilities of individual outcomes, and _then_ to use those probability estimates to derive estimates of the probabilities of overall categories. It might be that this bias encourages positive behavior change, if the people and/or organizations presenting information about a behavior are perceived as members of a group that they associate with positive stereotypes. This bias may also increase someone's motivation to start and continue a behavior, if they perceive it as being a requirement for belonging to a desired stereotyped group. On the other hand, there are also many cases where this fallacy may be counterproductive (such as when a behavior is seen as being associated with a stereotyped group that is perceived in a negative light), a benevolent helper could point out that this is an undesirable bias that has multiple negative impacts, and could encourage the person to focus on the behavior itself, rather than the people or organization(s) they associate (or don't associate) with it.

Suppressed Evidence Fallacy,Desires,"Suppressed Evidence Fallacy refers to the intentional failure to acknowledge or weigh up significant and relevant information that contradicts one's conclusion. This is also known as cherry picking (because only certain evidence - the information in support of the person's conclusion - is being chosen, while the rest is being suppressed). When someone is employing this fallacy to avoid engaging with a positive behavior or to justify engaging in a negative behavior, it may be worth bringing relevant (and thus far ignored) evidence to the person's attention, if the person is deemed unlikely to know the information and if the backfire risk is judged to be sufficiently low. However, if the person might already be aware of, and/or might be avoiding engaging with this evidence due to an aversion to the implications of that evidence, then it may be better to use a less confrontational and more indirect approach to encouraging them to update their beliefs; in such cases, similar strategies could be helpful here as in response to the Appeal to Consequences fallacy.",weigh suppressed intentional cherry contradicts person's acknowledge picking refers fallacy,"['contradict', 'contradicts', 'disprove', 'evidence', 'ignore', 'misrepresent', 'outweigh', 'refute', 'subjective', 'suppress', 'weigh']"
System Justification,Considers,"System Justification Theory refers to a social psychology theory that posits that people are motivated to desire, maintain and defend the status quo. This bias is motivational in nature (which makes it conceptually distinct from the (cognitive) phenomenon of Status Quo Bias). System Justification appears to be exacerbated under conditions of psychological threat, or when someone's needs are being met by the system they are justifying. To overcome this bias, ask people to consider whether or not they'd press an imaginary ""reset"" button if given the opportunity. For example, if the status quo involves social stigmas or even violence against a minority group, ask people whether they'd be willing to press an imaginary ""reset"" button that completely erases all current prejudices (even if these prejudices might re-develop over time). Defense of the status quo can also occur when people haven't imagined the alternatives vividly enough. For example, calls to ""defund the police"" often cause people to imagine a society in chaos and collapse, and thus to continue funding the police; so opponents of police funding may have to work extra hard to help the public to imagine what a society could look like if less money was spent on policing and more money was spent on education, social services, and healthcare.",posits exacerbated conceptually justifying quo cognitive distinct motivated someone's psychological,"['change', 'construed', 'dec', 'justification', 'justifications', 'justify', 'maintain', 'quo', 'sql', 'status quo', 'subjective', 'supra', 'system', 'une']"
Telescoping Effect in Memory,Maintains,"The Telescoping Effect in Memory refers to both ""backward telescoping,"" which is the perception that recent events occurred long ago (relative to how long ago they actually occurred), and to ""forward telescoping,"" which is the perception that distant events occurred more recently than they did in reality. It is also thought that there are also some events (between backward and forward telescoping) which are just as likely to be displaced backward as forward in time. This effect may interact with the way in which people plan for and implement behavioral changes over the long-term. For example, for behaviors that require regular investments of time and effort to be maintained, forward telescoping might cause someone to underestimate the time that has passed since their most recent investment of time/effort, which might reduce the probability that they will continue investing this time/effort as often as they originally planned to. To reduce the detrimental impacts of this effect, people could be encouraged to make explicit, time-based plans to implement the behavior, and could be encouraged to keep track of when they engage in the behavior. They could also use regular reminders to continue to engage in the next steps they planned (at the intervals that they committed to a priori).",telescoping displaced backward distant perception refers occurred relative forward reality,"['asteroid', 'astronomer', 'astronomers', 'backward', 'comet', 'earlier', 'event', 'flyby', 'forward', 'galaxies', 'lander', 'memory', 'recent', 'remember', 'telescope', 'telescopes', 'time']"
The Accuracy of our Memories of our Emotional Responses,Desires,"It has been noted that humans do not tend to maintain accurate memories of our emotional responses to events. To overcome this bias, ask people (1) to document carefully emotional responses that occur after performing a relevant action and (2) to review their documentation regularly to maintain the accuracy of their memory of the action and their emotional responses.",memories emotional maintain noted accurate humans responses tend events our,"['accuracy', 'adrenaline', 'emotion', 'emotions', 'events', 'feelings', 'grief', 'memories', 'memory', 'remember', 'response', 'subjective', 'tears']"
The Fallacy of Difference,Intends,"The Fallacy of Difference refers to a tendency to attribute the outcome of a situation to the traits that make that situation most unusual. To overcome this bias, encourage statistical thinking. Uncommon traits make a situation anecdotally interesting, of course, but usually a situation results in a certain outcome because of statistically common (not rare) traits.",traits tendency attribute outcome refers fallacy unusual situation difference most,"['behaviors', 'characteristics', 'difference', 'gene', 'genes', 'genetic', 'outcome', 'qualities', 'similarities', 'subjective', 'trait', 'traits', 'unusual']"
Thinking in Categories / Binary Thinking,Desires,"Binary Thinking involves thinking of concepts as being composed of just two options, such as ""good"" or ""bad,"" or ""right"" or ""wrong."" Thinking in Categories, as its name suggests, involves conceptualizing things into simple categories: this can involve more than two categories, but it still represents more simplistic thinking than when people conceptualize a concept as occurring on a continuum (continuum thinking). Ask people to compare extremes within one of their categories as a way of showing that the category is too simple. For example, if they view all exercise as ""hard,"" ask them whether walking for 5 minutes is as difficult as running a marathon. Similarly, for all of the items in all of the categories, sort them along each spectrum from lowest to highest. Also, point out to people that simple categories often represent a conflation or compression of multiple spectra. For example, ""good and bad"" actually includes spectra like intentions (an action can be performed with more or less benevolent motivations), consequences (an action can have more or less beneficial outcomes), context (an action is more or less socially acceptable in certain circumstances), etc.",continuum occurring simplistic composed categories involves concepts involve suggests binary,"['alternatives', 'binaries', 'binary', 'bitmap', 'boolean', 'category', 'continuous', 'correlation', 'deterministic', 'dichotomy', 'filename', 'multiple', 'orthogonal', 'subjective', 'two']"
Thought-Terminating Cliché,Desires,"A Thought-Terminating Cliché refers to a saying that is intended to prevent further thought about a given topic. The cliché itself must be examined and questioned. If the cliché is ""Dear leader knows best,"" then one can ask questions like: Is the leader actually dear to me? Are they the rightful leader? How does the leader know what's best? And does ""best"" mean best for the leader or best for all of us? Against what theory of morality is ""best"" measured? What happens if the leader is incapacitated? Is it impossible for someone else to know better than the leader? What are the leader's incentives? What are the incentives of those who are deploying the cliché?",refers topic prevent intended further saying given thought about that,"['analogy', 'axiom', 'cliche', 'joke', 'maxim', 'metaphor', 'oxymoron', 'prevent', 'proverb', 'refrain', 'stereotype', 'stop', 'terimate', 'thought', 'topic']"
Trait Ascription Bias,Intends,"Trait Ascription Bias refers to a tendency for people to view themselves as relatively variable in terms of personality, behavior and mood, while viewing others as much more predictable. It has been hypothesized that this may arise because our own internal states are directly observable and available to us (which is, of course, not the case for the mental states of others). It might be that this bias encourages positive behavior change, if this increases the degree to which someone considers and plans for the ways in which the behavior change might need to be adapted to the unique peculiarities of their life. On the other hand, this may also limit the degree to which someone thinks that the success of others in the behavior change might also apply to them (e.g., they may reason that, while the behavior [e.g., aerobic exercise] tends to produce positive mood changes in other people, the effects in themselves will be less predictable, owing to their [seemingly] more complex and varying range of affective states). This might decrease the relative desirability of the behavior, or might change the person's perception of the best way to plan for (and to get the required resources for) the behavior. A benevolent helper could point out that other people also have a complex and varied range of internal experiences, and/or could provide other information that might prompt the person to reconsider how they are viewing the situation in question.",hypothesized predictable trait mood observable tendency arise personality bias refers,"['ascribe', 'attitude', 'attitudes', 'behavior', 'behaviors', 'characteristics', 'mood', 'personality', 'stable', 'subjective', 'trait', 'variable']"
Two Wrongs Make a Right Fallacy,Chooses,"The ""Two Wrongs Make a Right"" Fallacy is the fallacious assumption that one moral wrongdoing can be justified by another wrongdoing. To overcome this fallacy, ask people to consider how they'd feel if someone else (or their past or future selves) committed the same two wrongs. For example, imagine that a person failed to go to the gym one day and then thought, ""Well, I failed today, so I might as well have some cake, too!"" Ask the person if they would condone these behaviors if someone else (or a past or future version of themself) was performing them.",wrongdoing wrongs fallacious fallacy justified assumption moral another right two,"['abuses', 'allegations', 'falsified', 'guilt', 'improper', 'irregularities', 'misconduct', 'multiple', 'negligent', 'right', 'violated', 'violations', 'wrong', 'wrongdoing']"
Typical Mind Fallacy,Considers,"The Typical Mind Fallacy is the fallacious assumption that one's own mind is ""typical,"" and that other minds in the general population are therefore similar to one's own. This fallacy may be particularly for those planning behavior change interventions: if they engage in this fallacy, they may run the risk of planning interventions that are ill-suited to their target audience, because of incorrectly assuming that others' minds will contain the same reasoning processes and information as the mind of the intervention designer. This might reduce the probability that the target audience becomes aware of key information relevant to the behavior change in question, and/or might change the relative desirability of the behavior, depending on the way in which it was communicated. A benevolent helper could remind people that everyone is different, and/or could encourage people to gather further information prior to forming conclusions about the beliefs and thought processes of the target audience.

Ultimate Attribution Error,Desires,"Ultimate Attribution Error refers to an attribution error whereby someone views the causes of negative behavior of people belonging to an outgroup (and positive behavior of those in an ingroup) to be attributable to internal causes (e.g., personality traits), but views the causes of positive behavior among outgroup members (and negative behavior among ingroup members) to be attributable to external causes.

Unit Bias,Chooses,"Unit Bias refers to a preference for finishing a given unit of a task or an item. Change the unit size (e.g., reduce the portion size for food, break the task into smaller subtasks, etc.).

Well-travelled Road Effect,Believes,"The Well-travelled Road Effect refers to a cognitive bias whereby people estimate shorter travel times for routes with which they are familiar (compared to routes with which they are unfamiliar). To overcome this effect, incentivize people to perform unfamiliar actions enough that they develop familiarity with them. To leverage this effect, build on top of pre-existing habits (sometimes called ""habit chaining"").",cognitive routes unfamiliar whereby estimate shorter bias refers travel familiar,"['familiar', 'fares', 'journey', 'long', 'road', 'route', 'routes', 'short', 'time', 'travel', 'traveling', 'trek', 'trip', 'trips']"
Zeigarnik Effect in Memory,Knows,"The Zeigarnik Effect is named after Bluma Zeigarnik, whose dissertation studied the tendency for people to remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks.

Zero-risk Bias,Desires,"Zero-risk Bias refers to the cognitive bias favoring opportunities to eliminate rather than mitigate a risk. For a minority of people, when there are multiple possible courses of action, some of which involve complete elimination of a subcategory of risk, and others of which do not, this bias can cause people to irrationally favor options including complete elimination of a subcategory of risk, even if other options come with a greater absolute reduction in risk overall. In some cases, this bias might encourage positive behaviors or discourage negative ones, in which case it might not need to be rectified. For example, a person recovering from alcoholism might opt to ban themselves from ever having alcohol, because they would prefer to have zero risk of recidivism. However, the bias could also distort the way in which someone reasons about the relative importance of different behavioral possibilities and outcomes, which might change how they choose, plan for, implement and maintain behavior changes. For example, someone who is attempting to decrease the environmental harms associated with their lifestyle might focus on completely eliminating their use of plastic straws (because this would reduce their production of plastic straw waste to zero), while neglecting other actions that they could take to reduce the harm they produce to a much greater degree (even though risks in other categories couldn't be reduced to zero, and might not be able to be estimated precisely). In such situations, a possible solution could be to make the person aware of the possibility that their choices of behavior change strategies might be influenced by this bias. Over the longer-term, it might be helpful to encourage people to practice probabilistic reasoning, potentially including writing down the estimated risks associated with each of the possible outcomes/choices, along with the predicted risks following different actions. They may find that they were focusing on eliminating a specific type of risk, but that there are other risks they could be focusing on instead, which would be associated with much greater expected risk reductions (despite being associated with uncertainty).",irrationally favoring mitigate cognitive elimination courses opportunities reduction bias refers,"['eliminate', 'eliminates', 'large', 'minimize', 'minimized', 'mitigate', 'outweigh', 'prevent', 'reduce', 'reduces', 'reducing', 'risk', 'safe', 'small', 'zero']"
