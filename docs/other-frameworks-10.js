		The [MINDSPACE](https://www.bi.team/publications/mindspace/) framework is a checklist of potentially powerful influences on people's behavior, originally designed for policy-makers by Paul Dolan, Michael Hallsworth, David Halpern, Dominic King, and Ivo Vlaev. It was used by the [Behavioral Insights Team](https://www.bi.team/) prior to the development of the EAST framework. These behavioral influences are captured in the acronym MINDSPACE:

		- **Messenger**: Depending on who delivers the information, we may be more - or less - likely to act upon it. We are influenced by factors like how much we like and trust the messenger, how much of an authority we believe them to be, how official the communication is, how similar the messenger is to us, etc.
		- **Incentives**: Financial incentives have been widely used by governments to motivate people to take action. This framework also considers non-financial incentives and proposes different ways to frame them, taking into account different biases such as loss aversion, anchoring, mental accounting, and hyperbolic discounting. Five psychological facts impact the effectiveness of incentives:
			1. "Losses loom larger than gains."
			2. "Reference points matter." (For instance, if we expect to get money, then not getting it may be considered a "loss"; whereas if we _didn't_ expect to get it, then not getting it may be considered neutral.)
			3. "We overweight small probabilities."
			4. "We mentally allocate money to discrete bundles." (For example, if people view money they have received as a "rebate" versus "extra income," they may act differently with that money.)
			5. "We live for today at the expense of tomorrow."
		- **Norm**: We tend to conform to social norms or copy what those around us do. Thus, if a certain behavior is presented as common, socially acceptable, or typical, it is more likely that we will adopt it. The downside is that if we accidentally signal that bad behavior is normal or common, we may accidentally increase the behavior we are trying to reduce. Five lessons about norms that can be leveraged are:
			1. "If the norm is desirable, let people know about it."
			2. "Relate the norm to your target audience as much as possible." (In other words, make it clear that it is about people just like them.)
			3. "Consider social networks." (This should be done because norms and information pass from person to person.)
			4. "Norms may need reinforcing." (In other words, you may need to remind people of the norm multiple times so that effects don't fade.)
			5. "Be careful when dealing with undesirable norms."
		- **Defaults**: People often choose to go with the preset option either because it is the easiest action to take, they don't want to make a choice, or they assume it is the default for a good reason. Hence, it is important not to let the default be set at random; instead, take time to consider what the most beneficial default configuration should be.
		- **Salience**: We are surrounded by constant stimuli. Our minds subconsciously filter out the less relevant information, and make us aware only of what is particularly noticeable. Novelty, surprise, accessibility, contrast, and simplicity are characteristics that make something more salient. "Anchors", which suggest a value, amount, or price, may make a particular number more salient. Salient occurrences in the past are more likely to be recalled from memory when we're making decisions.
		- **Priming**: People's behavior may in some contexts be impacted by subconscious cues, such as the display of walking shoes and running magazines to prime thoughts or actions related to a healthy lifestyle.
		- **Affect**: Emotional responses and moods greatly influence judgements and decision-making. For instance, "People in good moods make unrealistically optimistic judgements, whilst those in bad moods make unrealistically pessimistic judgements." And in some cases, our actions are more driven by how we _feel_ about a thing than what we _think_ about the thing. Evoking emotion can be a powerfully motivating tool for change, but on the other hand, it should be done with care to avoid creating unnecessary negative emotions.
		- **Commitment**: When we make a commitment, we try to stick to it. Different types of commitment include written contracts, letting other people know about our intentions, and imposing penalties on ourselves. We "seek to be consistent with our public promises," and we feel the need to reciprocate others' prosocial behaviors with prosocial behavior of our own.
		- **Ego**: People have a desire to maintain a positive and consistent self-image, and behavior often reflects that desire. We also tend to want our behaviors and beliefs to be consistent with each other, and our future actions to be consistent with our past actions, which can lead to strategies for behavior change (e.g., getting a person to take one small action in a particular direction can facilitate further actions in that same direction). Additionally, we tend to compare ourselves against those around us, which can influence how we feel about our actions and ourselves.

		**Connection**: When using the Ten Conditions for Change, you first identify which conditions are not being met, and then choose the most appropriate strategies to design a behavior change intervention. MINDSPACE provides categories of useful behavior change strategies that could be applied when using the Ten Conditions for Change framework. For example, if the desired behavior is that children should eat more fruit at the school cafeteria, and our framework diagnoses that the Chooses condition is not being met, then a possible intervention is to offer fruit bowls in which the fruit is already cut up and presented in an appealing way at the beginning of the food line (which is an intervention that attempts to increase Salience).
