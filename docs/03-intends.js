	description: `
		Even if we desire adopting a new behavior, we're very unlikely to actually do so unless we ourselves predict that we will conduct that behavior at specific times, in specific situations, or within a certain time frame. There are a variety of reasons we may not intend to engage in a behavior even when we find the behavior desirable:

		<ol type="A">
			<li><b>Busyness</b>—e.g., we may think "I don't have time in my life right now to start a behavior like this"</li>
			<li><b>Delay</b>—e.g., we may think "I'll get around to doing this eventually"</li>
			<li><b>Lack of Self-Efficacy</b>—e.g., we may think "I'll probably fail if I try to engage in this behavior"</li>
			<li><b>Ambiguity</b>—e.g., we may think "I don't know how to get started"</li>
		</ol>
