		To solve many of the most pressing problems in the world, it will be necessary to help people create new positive behaviors. Whether your goal is to improve mental health, stop global warming, or mitigate risks from advanced technologies, behavioral challenges will stand in the way. Sometimes, these challenges will involve the behaviors of individuals, consumers, or aid recipients. Other times, they will involve the behaviors of politicians, government officials, or CEOs. You may also need to apply these strategies to solve problems in your own life.

		Yet behavior change frequently fails. Why does it fail? And what can you do to make it more likely to succeed?

		We've created the Ten Conditions for Change framework to help answer these questions. We hope this framework will enhance your efforts to improve the world, or to change your own life for the better.

		There are, of course, a number of useful behavior change frameworks already in existence. With that fact in mind, we've specifically aimed to create a framework that:

		1. **can easily be applied to practical problems** in a step-by-step fashion by individuals and teams, regardless of their level of experience designing behavior change interventions; and that...
		2. **provides a comprehensive system** that can account for the huge range of different techniques used in practice (i.e., not simplifying the realm of consideration to a limited number of techniques).

		At the bottom of this page, we also provide simplified summaries of a number of other behavior change frameworks, and explain how each relates to our Ten Conditions for Change model.
