	year: 2007,

	content: `
		The [Fogg Behavior Model](http://behaviormodel.org/) (FBM), created by [BJ Fogg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._J._Fogg), suggests that three different ingredients are needed at a given moment in order for a behavior to occur, namely:

		1. *Motivation*, with core motivators being pleasure/pain, hope/fear, and social acceptance/rejection.
		2. *Ability*, which is a measure of whether the task is easy or hard to do, and which takes into account expenditures of various "Simplicity Factors" needed to engage in the behavior, such as time, money, physical effort, brain cycles, social deviance, and non-routine. More specifically, "Ability" refers to how the Simplicity Factors work together in the context of a Prompt.
		3. *Prompts*, which are ways that a person can be reminded to do a thing. Prompts can be "Facilitators," which assist in a behavior (e.g., a software tooltip), "Signals," which indicate to us that an event has occurred (e.g., a chime sound when you receive an email), or "Sparks," which cause a sudden boost of motivation (e.g., a message with a sudden discount).

		If a well-timed Prompt occurs when Motivation is sufficiently high relative to the level of Ability required, then the person is likely to succeed at engaging in the behavior.

		**Connection**: The Fogg Behavior Model (FBM) relates to the Ten Conditions for Change framework in that our Desires, Believes, and Chooses conditions relate to the FBM Motivation ingredient; our Knows, Has, and Embodies conditions relate to the FBM Ability ingredient; and our Considers, Intends, and Remembers conditions relate to the FBM Prompts ingredient.
