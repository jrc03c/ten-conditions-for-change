	title: "The Health Belief Model (1950s)",

	year: 1950,

	content: `
		The [Health Belief Model](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/109019817400200403) was initially developed in the 1950s by [Irwin M. Rosenstock, Godfrey M. Hochbaum, S. Stephen Kegeles, and Howard Leventhal](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.856.1372&rep=rep1&type=pdf) for the U.S. Public Health Service, to understand the failure of screening and health prevention programs. Since then, it has been used to predict and affect a wide array of health behaviors from acceptance of immunizations to adherence to medical treatments and adoption of healthy lifestyle choices. Rosenstock states:

		> In order for Behavioral Change to succeed, people must have an incentive to take action, feel threatened by their current behavioral patterns and believe that change of a specific kind will be beneficial by resulting in a valued outcome at acceptable cost, but they must also feel themselves competent to implement that change.

		Therefore, there are several variables that affect a person's willingness to change their behavior:

		- **Perceived threat**: The combination of two factors:
			- **Perceived susceptibility** - the subjective assessment of the likelihood of developing a health problem.
			- **Perceived severity** - how serious the person believes that the threat is.
		- **Perceived benefits**: The belief that doing the behavior will lead to desired outcomes.
		- **Perceived barriers**: The perceived obstacles a person would face to perform the behavior, such as financial costs, phobic reactions, physical barriers, side-effects, accessibility factors, and personality characteristics.
		- **Self-efficacy**: This variable was [added to the model in the 1980s](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/109019818801500203) and refers to an individual's belief in his or her capacity to execute specific behaviors.

		The model asserts that a person's beliefs and perceptions are affected by **modifying factors**: demographic, socio-psychological, and structural variables like sex, age, income level, or education level. It also highlights the need for **cues to action**, which are the instigating events that set the behavior change process in motion. They can either be internal (e.g., a person starting to feel sick) or external (e.g., a conversation with a physician or something read in social media). If the perceived threat is low, the required intensity of the cue is high.

		**Connection**: The behavior change strategies that would make the threat salient as well as those that provide external cues to action help meet the Considers condition in our framework. Perceived benefits are key to meeting the Desires condition, and self-efficacy relates to the Intends condition if it is about the behavior as a whole (e.g., a person believing that they can lose weight) and to the Believes condition if it is about specific actions towards the desired behavior (e.g., a person believing they can avoid buying unhealthy food when they go shopping). Strategies that aim to reduce the perceived barriers mostly relate to the Has, Knows, and Embodies conditions (and to the Chooses and Remembers conditions to some extent).
