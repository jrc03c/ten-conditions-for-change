	title: "Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) (1992)",

	year: 1992,

	content: `
		The [Health Action Process Approach](http://www.hapa-model.de/), developed by [Dr. Ralf Schwarzer](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1464-0597.2007.00325.x), is built on the premise that changing health-related behaviors requires two phases:

		1. **Motivational Phase**: An intention to change is developed.
		1. **Volitional Phase**: The change is planned, initiated, and maintained while managing relapses.

		In other words, the Motivational Phase leads to a behavioral intention and the Volitional Phase leads to the actual behavior.

		During each phase, different mediating cognitions emerge. There are three main mediating cognitions in the Motivational Phase:

		- **Risk Perception** is useful to create a contemplative process (e.g., "smoking kills"), but it alone does not form an intention.
		- **Outcome Expectancies** are subjective beliefs about the result of the behavior change (e.g., "If I quit smoking, my overall health will improve"). More positive and less negative outcome expectancies will result in greater likelihood that a person develops an intention.
		- **Action Self-Efficacy** is a person's belief that they are able to adopt a behavior change (e.g., "I can quit smoking if I try").

		As soon as a person has an intention to change their behavior, they have to develop a plan to put it in action. Once the change has been planned and initiated, it has to be maintained. This phase, the Volitional Phase, involves these four mediating cognitions:

		- **Action Planning** fills the gap between intention and action, and requires developing "detailed action plans of when, where, and how to perform the desired action". It involves taking into account that some health behavior changes require one individual action (like receiving an immunization shot), whereas others require a recurring action (like exercising regularly).
		- **Coping Planning** involves identifying obstacles that may get in the way of a behavior change and determining what to do if those obstacles present themselves. For example, if the plan is to go to the gym three times per week and the person will be going on vacation soon, they should come up with a plan to exercise while being away.
		- **Maintenance Self-Efficacy** represents a person's optimistic beliefs that they will overcome obstacles that arise during the maintenance phase (e.g., "I feel confident that, when I'm anxious, I will be able to resist the desire to smoke").
		- **Recovery Self-Efficacy** "addresses the experience of failure and recovery from setbacks." (For example, "After months of not smoking, I had a rough week at work and I smoked every night. I feel confident that I can quit again.")

		Therefore, according to this framework, individuals pass through different mindsets on their way to behavior change: people in the Motivational Phase are identified as _non-intenders_, and those in the Volitional Phase are either _intenders_ - if they are in the process of planning but have not yet initiated the action - or _actors_. When designing interventions, it is important to tailor them to the group that the target individuals belong to.

		**Connection**: Both the HAPA and the Ten Conditions for Change frameworks provide descriptions of how people move through different stages as they change behaviors. The DECISION phase of the Ten Conditions for Change framework relates to the Motivational Phase in the HAPA, and the ACTION and CONTINUATION phases relate to the Volitional phase. But whereas planning interventions (Action Planning and Coping Planning) fall under the Volitional Phase in the HAPA framework, those interventions help meet the Intends condition in the DECISION phase of our framework. Risk Perception and Outcome Expectancies, cognitions of the Motivational Phase, may be used to meet the Considers and Desires conditions. Action Planning, Coping Planning, and Self-Efficacy connect with the Intends, Knows, and Believes conditions, respectively, in our framework.
