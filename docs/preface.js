		Behavior change is hard. This website is designed to make it easier.

		Here you will find our step-by-step behavior change framework (the "Ten Conditions for Change") along with our behavioral strategy search engine and concise summaries of seventeen other useful frameworks.

		You can use the Ten Conditions for Change to help others (e.g., through creating healthier eating behaviors or increasing vaccine adoption) or to create a positive change in your own life (e.g., by getting yourself to exercise more or practice relaxation techniques daily).

		The "ten conditions" in this framework are designed to be _sufficient_ for creating a new positive behavior. Read on to learn how the framework works (or [try our interactive tool here](https://programs.clearerthinking.org/change_behavior.html)).

		<hr class="long">

		Successfully adopting a complex, positive behavior involves:

		<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
			<li>making a <span class="is-highlighted is-orange">DECISION</span> to adopt the new behavior,</li>
			<li>performing a number of <span class="is-highlighted is-green">ACTIONs</span> that comprise the new behavior, and</li>
			<li>ensuring the <span class="is-highlighted is-purple">CONTINUATION</span> of the relevant conditions for success as time passes.</li>
		</ol>

		<img class="diagram" src="res/img/diagram.png">

		For instance, if the behavior you are trying to create is going to the gym daily, then the three phases might look like this:

		<img class="diagram" src="res/img/diagram-example.png">

		More specifically, a person will very likely continue to engage in a new positive behavior if the ten conditions are met.

		There are three conditions to meet in the <span class="is-highlighted is-orange">DECISION</span> phase:

			<table class="special-preface-table">

					<td>

		</div>

		There are six conditions to meet for every <span class="is-highlighted is-green">ACTION</span>:

		<div>
			<table class="special-preface-table">

					<td>
						<img src="res/img/remembers.png" class="img-inline">&nbsp;&nbsp;

						</a>
						skills and traits needed to perform each action

				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		And there is one condition to meet for <span class="is-highlighted is-purple">CONTINUATION</span>:

		<div>
			<table class="special-preface-table">
				<tr>
					<td>
						<img src="res/img/maintains.png" class="img-inline">&nbsp;&nbsp;
					</td>
					<td>
						<a class="black-fake-link" onclick="radio.broadcast('go-to-substep', 'maintains')">
							Maintains
						</a>
						internal attributes and external conditions required to perform future needed actions
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		Here you can see each condition in its corresponding phase:

		<img class="diagram" src="res/img/diagram2.png">

		The Ten Conditions are designed to be jointly _sufficient_ (rather than _necessary_) for a behavior to occur. That means that if all of the Ten Conditions are met, then a person will very likely engage in the desired behavior:

		<img class="diagram" src="res/img/diagram-sufficiency.png">

		This also means that if a behavior is not occurring, then it is very likely that <b>one or more of the Ten Conditions is not being met</b>. Thus, you can use the Ten Conditions as a diagnostic tool to pinpoint why a behavior is not occurring. Just go condition-by-condition to find the conditions that are failing:

		Read on to learn much more about how to use the framework, explore how each of the Ten Conditions works, and discover hundreds of behavior change strategies organized by which of the Ten Conditions they target.
