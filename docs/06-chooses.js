	description: `
		Even if we remember to perform an action, we're very unlikely to perform that action unless we choose it over the other actions or opportunities that are available to us at the same time. There are various reasons why we may not choose to do an action, even if we've remembered we are supposed to do it:

		<ol type="A">
			<li><b>Temptation</b>—e.g., we may think "It would be more fun and relaxing to watch TV instead"</li>
			<li><b>Unpleasantness</b>—e.g., we may avoid an action because it is unappealing or because we believe it will be unpleasant to carry out</li>
			<li><b>Distraction</b>—e.g., we may start the action but get distracted in the middle by something else</li>
			<li><b>Opportunity Cost</b>—e.g., we may think "It's more important that I do this other thing right now"</li>
			<li><b>Time</b>—e.g., we may think "I don't have enough time to complete this action right now"</li>
			<li><b>Anxiety</b>—e.g., we may feel stressed about the idea of trying to carry out the action, and so avoid attempting it</li>
			<li><b>Confusion</b>—e.g., we may feel uncertainty about how to start the action, and so not start it at all</li>
		</ol>
