		This framework provides ten "conditions for change" that are designed to be *sufficient* for succeeding at creating a new positive behavior. That is, we provide ten conditions that are very likely to produce behavior change if the intended person or population meets all of them. This structure also implies that any person who is failing to carry out a desired behavior change likely isn't meeting one or more of these ten conditions. If you can increase the likelihood of meeting these conditions, you can increase the chance that behavior change will occur. By "condition" in this context, we mean "a state of affairs that must be satisfied in order for a particular outcome to occur." In other words, we think that behavior change is likely to occur when these ten states of affairs are satisfied.

		That means that this framework provides a systematic way to analyze a desired behavior for a desired person or population, and then to develop a strategy to increase the chance of successful adoption of the behavior. It also provides a method for analyzing why the behavior is not occurring already.

		This framework is specifically designed for positive, "complex" behaviors which require the target person or population to engage willingly in the change and to perform multiple actions across time.

		The Ten Conditions for Change framework provides a way of organizing and systematizing thinking about behavior change. There are numerous behavior change strategies - so many that it's hard to know where to begin. This framework can help you identify those strategies that are most appropriate for your situation and mission. Furthermore, it's easy to miss important considerations in behavior change projects, and these overlooked considerations may ultimately lead to failure. By using this systematic process, we think you will be less likely to overlook important details regarding what you need to make your behavior change efforts succeed.

		**Structure**

		The framework is organized into three main phases: <span class="is-highlighted is-orange">DECISION</span>, <span class="is-highlighted is-green">ACTION</span>, and <span class="is-highlighted is-purple">CONTINUATION</span>. The ten conditions together make up these three phases. Here again is an outline of the whole framework:

		<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman">
			<li><span class="is-highlighted is-orange">DECISION</span></li>
		</ol>

		<ol>
			<ol>
				<li><u>Considers</u> changing the behavior</li>
				<li><u>Desires</u> changing the behavior</li>
				<li><u>Intends</u> to change the behavior</li>
			</ol>
		</ol>

		<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman" start="2">
			<li><span class="is-highlighted is-green">ACTION</span></li>
		</ol>

		<ol>
			<ol start="4">
				<li><u>Remembers</u> to perform each action</li>
				<li><u>Believes</u> performing each action will help achieve the goal</li>
				<li><u>Chooses</u> to perform each action</li>
				<li><u>Knows</u> how to perform each action</li>
				<li><u>Has</u> needed resources to perform each action</li>
				<li><u>Embodies</u> skills and traits needed to perform each action</li>
			</ol>
		</ol>

		<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman" start="3">
			<li><span class="is-highlighted is-purple">CONTINUATION</span></li>
		</ol>

		<ol>
			<ol start="10">
				<li><u>Maintains</u> attributes required to perform future needed actions</li>
			</ol>
		</ol>

		The <span class="is-highlighted is-orange">DECISION</span> phase refers to conditions that are sufficient for a person to decide to change their behavior. For instance, if someone smokes cigarettes habitually, they'll have to make a _decision to quit_ before they'll _take action to quit_. Often, a decision only needs to be made once; but if the target person later changes their mind about changing their behavior, then the decision will need to be re-made.

		The <span class="is-highlighted is-green">ACTION</span> phase refers to conditions that are sufficient for a person to perform the various actions that together constitute a successful behavior change. Most complex behaviors will involve taking a number of different actions which are spread out across time, and the <span class="is-highlighted is-green">ACTION</span> phase should be applied to each of these actions separately. For instance, if someone is trying to completely quit smoking, they may have to change their behavior of buying cigarettes and their behavior of borrowing cigarettes from people at events, and perhaps also replace the habitual action of smoking with some alternative action instead.

		The <span class="is-highlighted is-purple">CONTINUATION</span> phase refers to conditions that are sufficient for a person to continue the <span class="is-highlighted is-orange">DECISION</span> and <span class="is-highlighted is-green">ACTION</span> processes (that is, to prevent those conditions from failing to be met after initial actions are performed and as time passes). So, for instance, if a person avoids smoking cigarettes one time but finds the experience so frustrating that it changes their opinion about quitting, or if a person's motivation for quitting cigarettes falls over time, then the <span class="is-highlighted is-purple">CONTINUATION</span> phase would involve diagnosing and fixing the person's negative attitudes or lack of motivation so that they can re-make the <span class="is-highlighted is-orange">DECISION</span> to quit and then re-perform the <span class="is-highlighted is-green">ACTIONs</span> required to quit.

		**Other Considerations**

		In practice, given your role, your resources, and the nature of the problem, you may only be capable of influencing some of the ten conditions in this framework and not others. Similarly, not all of the conditions are equally likely to improve. If multiple conditions for change are not met, you will likely want to focus first on the one or two that would be easiest or most cost-effective to change; but it may still be worth analyzing the other remaining conditions anyway to make sure that the conditions outside of your control don't doom your project to failure.

		If a previous behavior change project failed, going through this list of ten conditions can also help you figure out why it failed. Ask yourself: "Which of the conditions likely weren't satisfied, therefore causing the target population to fail to adopt the target behavior?"
