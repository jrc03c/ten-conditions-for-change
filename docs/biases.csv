Actor-Observer Asymmetry,,yes,"The Actor-Observer Asymmetry occurs when people subconsciously attribute behavior to different causes depending on whether they're the person performing the behavior (the *actor*) or merely a witness (an *observer*). When assessing their own behavior as actors, people tend to emphasize the influence of the situation on their behavior and downplay the influence of their own personality or character. When assessing others' behavior as observers, the reverse is true: people's assessment of others' behavior tends to emphasize the influence of personality or character on the behavior and downplay the influence of the situation. See also: Fundamental Attribution Error.","This has been demonstrated in studies by differentiating between actors' and observers' explanations in the following way: people's explanations were separated into theoretically meaningful distinctions (e.g., reasons vs. causal history of reason explanations). The responses were categorized, and the differences emerged.",,"For example: ""I haven't been able to get into the habit of going to the gym because life has just been so busy lately. Every day, I go to work, come home and spend a few minutes with my kids and spouse, cook dinner, and work on remodeling our back porch. I don't have time to go to the gym! But I'm totally unlike my spouse: they avoid the gym out of pure laziness.""","actor, agent, observer, symmetry, asymmetry",3. Intends,"5. Believes, 10. Maintains","To overcome this bias, it might help to ask people to consider how a friend, loved one, or ideal person would have behaved in the same situation. For example, if a person skipped gym day because of a thunderstorm that day, ask them whether or not their gym buddy also missed that day because of the storm. By comparing their actions against other people in identical situations, they might see that the context was less relevant than they supposed and that their character was more relevant than they realized.",cognitive bias,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor%E2%80%93observer_bias,,,,,,,,
Ad Hoc Rescue,,yes,An Ad Hoc Rescue is an attempt to save a cherished belief by repeatedly revising the argument in favor of it to explain away problems.,,,"For example: ""I don't care if it gives me better cardiovascular health, better mental health, better sleep quality, and longer life expectancy---I still think that regular exercise would just be torture.""

For example, if you'd like to encourage someone to start giving to a high-impact charity, but they keep coming up with new reasons why this would be useless or harmful, you could show them objective evidence regarding the charity's impact. Of course, this assumes that they share the same values as you but believe other strategies are more effective. If they don't share the same values, then your attempts to address Ad Hoc Rescue may not help. ",rhetorical fallacy,,,,,,,,,
Ad Hominem Fallacy,,yes,The Ad Hominem Fallacy occurs when a person attacks the arguer instead of the argument in order to conclude that the argument is false.,,,"For example: ""That researcher is overweight!

To leverage this bias, you could deliver the message using a messenger that you know the audience will trust. In such a case, it's still important to tell the audience that the claims are true for reasons other than that they're being delivered by a trusted messenger; the trusted messenger only acts as a sort of Trojan horse to deploy the message behind the defenses of the audience, not as proof of the message's veracity.",rhetorical fallacy,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ad_hominem,,,,,,,,
Affirmative Conclusion from a Negative Premise Fallacy,,yes,"The Affirmative Conclusion from a Negative Premise Fallacy occurs when an affirmative conclusion is assumed to follow from two negative premises; for example: ""A is not a subset of B. B is not a subset of C. Therefore, A is a subset of C.""",,,"For example: ""We don't read that trash. People who read that trash don't appreciate real literature.

Affirming a Disjunct Fallacy,,yes,"Affirming a Disjunct Fallacy is a logical fallacy made in deductive arguments in which it is falsely assumed that if one statement or category applies, then another cannot apply. This fallacy has the form: ""A or B. A. Therefore, not B."" If it is possible for both A and B to be true at the same time (i.e., if they're not mutually exclusive), then it is erroneous to conclude that one disjunct must be false merely because the other disjunct is true.",,,"For example, someone might believe that either ""you stop smoking socially at parties"" *or* ""you keep enjoying parties"" without realizing that the two are not mutually exclusive categories.

Also, show examples where both disjuncts are true at the same time. In particular, it's important to show anecdotal evidence from the lives of loved ones when a person's reasoning is strongly motivated by emotion and/or identity, as in the cases of religion and politics.

Ambiguity Effect,,yes,The Ambiguity Effect is a cognitive bias wherein decision-makers tend to select options for which the probability of a favorable outcome is known instead of an option for which the probability of a favorable outcome is unknown or ambiguous.,,,"For example: ""I know that if I pick Door #1, I have a 15% chance of winning a moderately good prize. I also know that if I pick Door #2, I'll win a prize, but I don't know how good the prize will be or what the chances of winning are. I guess I'll pick Door #1!""

It might also help to develop an intuition for the probabilities by comparing them to commonly-known outcomes.",cognitive bias,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambiguity_effect,,,,,,,,
Anchoring Bias ,,yes,"The Anchoring Bias occurs when a person's expectation about one thing is affected by something they saw, heard, or thought before. In other words, it occurs when a person relies too heavily on a specific piece of information to govern their thought process.","In one study, an audience was asked to write the last two digits of their social security number and consider whether they would pay this number of dollars for items such as wine, chocolate, and computer equipment, the values of which they did not know. They were then asked to bid for these items. The result was that the audience members with higher two-digit numbers would submit bids that were between 60% and 120% higher than those with the lower social security numbers. Put simply, the higher the (social security) number in mind, the higher the bid. The social security numbers had become their ""anchors.""",Partly from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_(cognitive_bias) but looks like it is already reworded somewhat,"For example, when buying an expensive piece of software, the initial quote you get might anchor you to a particular price.

As another example, when negotiating a contract, the initial terms of the agreement might act as an anchor for the remainder of the negotiations. Wins might then be measured with respect to the original terms rather than in terms of absolute benefits or losses.","anchor, focus, specific, rely",2. Desires,3. Intends,"To overcome this bias, define one's expectations _before_ being exposed to potential anchors (e.g., prior to obtaining quotes, entering negotiations, and so on). It might also help to be reminded that one's memory of past experiences may be out-of-date or based on incorrect information. 

To leverage this bias, one could suggest a specific number (e.g., dollar amount) as a starting point for giving, negotiating, etc.",cognitive bias,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring,,,Q,,"On some tests, have a question that involves someone paying $15 for a hamburger and omit that question on other tests. On all tests, have a question asking how much money one considers to be ""expensive"" for a hamburger. See if the $15 mark has an anchoring effect.","Idea for a within-subjects test: Ask 2 different gambling questions, one with an anchor and one without, where the test taker has to say how much he/she'd risk in a certain game for a certain probability of reward. The 2 games would have to be similar in that it would be irrational for a person to be more risk averse in one than another, but they'd have to be different in way that prevented the test taker from realizing this. Also must be careful that a subject's different answers don't result from the framing bias, rather than the anchoring bias.",Focal Bias,The Cognitive Miser
Anecdotal Evidence Fallacy,,yes,The Anecdotal Evidence Fallacy is the discounting of evidence arrived at by systematic search or testing in favor of a few firsthand stories.,,,"For example: ""I'm going to carry on smoking. My grandfather smoked 40 cigarettes a day until he died at age 90.""","anecdote, statistics, evidence, story",2. Desires,3. Intends,"To overcome this fallacy, point out that anecdotes can never be generalized to a population. A population represents many individuals, but a single individual does not necessarily represent the population. So it's possible to tell a true anecdote that's nevertheless statistically rare for a population.

To leverage this fallacy, use anecdotes to describe what individual experiences may look like. If you do this, be sure to mention that the anecdotes are only part of the statistical story. In other words, remind people that ""your mileage may vary.""",rhetorical fallacy,,,rhetological fallacies spreadsheet,,,,,,
Appeal to Authority Fallacy,,yes,The Appeal to Authority Fallacy is the argument that a statement is correct because it was made by a person or source that the audience regards as authoritative.,,,"For example: ""As Samuel Johnson said, 'patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel.'""",authority,1. Considers,"2. Desires, 3. Intends","To overcome this fallacy, it could help to analyze the message itself after disconnecting it from the messenger. For example, ""I know you've adopted Diet X because Dr. Oz recommended it, but is it really true that X is safe and effective? I think you should see what the research shows about X before adopting it.""

To leverage this fallacy, you could ask trusted authority figures to deliver messages. For example, ""I'm Alex Trebec, and I want you to know how important it is to buy life insurance."" In such a case, it's still important to tell the audience that the claims are true for reasons other than that they're being delivered by a trusted messenger; the trusted messenger only acts as a sort of Trojan horse to deploy the message behind the defenses of the audience, not as proof of the message's veracity.",rhetorical fallacy,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/appeal_to_authority,,,,,,,,
Appeal to Common Practice Fallacy,,yes,The Appeal to Common Practice Fallacy is the claim that something is true or acceptable because it's commonly practiced.,,,"For example: ""This bank has some problems with corruption. But there's nothing going on here that doesn't go on in all the other banks.""

Another example: ""This procedure is practiced at 90% of hospitals, so it's the best option we've got for our patient!""","majority, common, popular, everyone",2. Desires,,"To overcome this fallacy, it could help to show counterexamples of times when a common practice or belief was later shown to be false, dangerous, or immoral. (This by itself doesn't prove that a claim is false; it only demonstrates that the majority isn't always right and that common practice isn't proof of truth or moral acceptability.) For example, owning slaves used to be a common practice around the world. The ubiquity of slavery, however, should not be taken as evidence that it was morally justifiable.",rhetorical fallacy,,,rhetological fallacies spreadsheet,,,,,,
Appeal to Consequences Fallacy,,yes,"The Appeal to Consequences Fallacy is an argument in which the validity of its premise (typically a belief) is judged based on whether the consequences of that premise lead to desirable or undesirable consequences. It typically has a form like: ""If P, then bad consequences. Therefore, not P."" Or: ""If P, then good consequences. Therefore, P!""",,,"For example: ""Your theory cannot possibly be true because if it were, our lives would be meaningless.""

Another example: ""This new exercise plan is going to hurt like heck, so it's probably not good for me.""

Another example: ""The last time I tried to stop smoking, I had horrible withdrawal symptoms. So it's probably best for me to just keep smoking.""","consequence, result, outcome, desirable, undesirable",2. Desires,"1. Considers, 3. Intends, 5. Believes, 6. Chooses","To overcome this fallacy, provide absurd, extreme, or humorous counterexamples to show that the truth of a proposition is not connected to its consequences. For example: ""If there were serial killers, then lots of people would die horrible deaths! Therefore, serial killers must not exist."" Or: ""If everyone was perfectly kind to each other, then we'd have no more wars. Therefore, everyone must already be perfectly kind to each other!""

Directly pointing out this fallacy might have the potential to backfire. This kind of reasoning can be associated with cognitive dissonance and motivated reasoning, which may decrease the degree to which people can engage rationally and productively with information or arguments contradicting their current thinking (e.g. [Rothgerber, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666319306324?casa_token=TbOa-8zyVboAAAAA:pwCeOrthXBA3hSOV8dSmUNyL5cIT4oeSJV3jYRNd5wCSseAtLw4rvD0cYYRU6VZRhBohasvyO7Y)). 

Motivated reasoning may become particularly problematic when the topic at hand is framed in moral terms (since topics framed in terms of morality can be associated with more polarization than those perceived through a pragmatic lens; [Abeywickrama et al., 2020](https://jspp.psychopen.eu/index.php/jspp/article/view/5263)). 

With these caveats in mind, given the right circumstances and the right person, it might sometimes be worth telling someone when it seems like this fallacy is affecting their reasoning (if the backfire risk appears to be sufficiently low). 

This may be worth taking into consideration when raising initial awareness of a given behavior or its consequences: if the target audience has certain ideas that they hold strongly and value highly, then it could backfire to convey information that directly challenges those beliefs. And when information _is_ presented that _could_ contradict someone's cherished beliefs, it might be preferable to share the information on its own---without sharing the conclusions or providing behavioral prescriptions---in order to encourage the person to come to their _own_ conclusions (for more information on this point, see the Generation Effect). 

Over the longer-term, it may help to encourage people to foster more epistemic humility, potentially through practicing dialogic argumentation in a wide variety of contexts ([Kuhn & Crowell, 2011](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797611402512?casa_token=j8n-fvNZXIcAAAAA%3ARQxwCnHBeC4V_rEOge0_-zqCBENDDml05g1n502cs7OTa8ADJ2pONhY88bhP2p3CHRm0C7RA6-lsww)). More research in this area is needed, but some evidence suggests that such approaches may enable people to become less attached to their desired conclusions ([Švaříček, 2019](https://www.phil.muni.cz/journals/index.php/studia-paedagogica/article/view/2063), which may increase their ability to form more realistic beliefs through the use of reasoning and evidence.",rhetorical fallacy,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/appeal_to_consequences,,,,,,,,
Appeal to Fear Fallacy,,yes,"The Appeal to Fear Fallacy is the argument that one of two things must be true and that, because one of the things is frightening, the other must be true. It usually has the form: ""Either P or Q is true. Q is frightening. Therefore, P.""",,,"For example, someone might be experiencing symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of Panic Disorder. They might believe: ""Either these symptoms represent panic attacks, or I'm just experiencing normal sensations that everyone feels. But having a Panic Disorder diagnosis sounds frightening to me. Therefore, I'm just experiencing normal sensations that everyone feels."" ","fear, scary",2. Desires,"1. Considers, 3. Intends, 5. Believes, 6. Chooses, 10. Maintains","To leverage this fallacy, highlight undesirable or risky outcomes that would result from failure to engage in a desired behavior change. It could also help to motivate people to maintain the behavior in cases where they either fear failure itself or fear the consequences of that failure. 

To overcome this fallacy, consider how severe the person's fear is and how strongly they hold their current beliefs relating to the feared outcome(s). Then, if it seems safe to do so, it might help to encourage the person to acknowledge the fear, analyze the reasons behind it, evaluate whether the fear is justified, and manage it directly. On the other hand, if the person has strongly-held beliefs relating to the fear or its consequences, it may be preferable to seek professional support. In the meantime, the strategies for the Appeal to Consequences Fallacy may also be worth considering.",rhetorical fallacy,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/appeal_to_fear,,,,,,,,
Appeal to Flattery Fallacy,,yes,"The Appeal to Flattery Fallacy is the use of an irrelevant compliment to slip in an unfounded claim; the audience might then accept the statement along with the flattery. It usually has the form: ""You have desirable property X, so of course you'll know that P is true.""",,,"For example: ""Intelligent and sophisticated readers will of course recognize a fallacy like this when they read one.""","flatter, compliment",2. Desires,"3. Intends, 5. Believes, 6. Chooses, 10. Maintains","To overcome this fallacy, recognize it and/or point it out. It may also help to re-evaluate any claims based on the evidence supporting them, rather than other factors (such as accompanying flattery). Those trying to support others in their behavior change efforts should also avoid giving unwarranted or falsely-inflated flattery. (As well as being dishonest / unethical, this would also run the risk of backfiring via the Argument from Fallacy.)",rhetorical fallacy,,,rhetological fallacies spreadsheet,,,,,,
Appeal to Hypocrisy Fallacy,,yes,The Appeal to Hypocrisy Fallacy is the argument that a position is wrong because the person arguing for it does not live in accordance with it.,,,"For example: ""He says lying is wrong. But look at him! He's been known to lie himself!""

Another example: ""The big oil companies tell us that we as individuals should do more to prevent climate change by reducing, reusing, and recycling.

Chooses","To overcome this fallacy, you should ideally adopt the behavior in question (or give a costly signal that you intend to adopt it) before encouraging others to do so. In cases where other people are providing behavioral advice or tips, it may be advisable for the person explaining it to be selected based on their own experience in engaging in the behavior in question so that their advice is (at least perceived to be) more credible.",rhetorical fallacy,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tu_quoque,,,,,,,,
Appeal to Incredulity Fallacy,,yes,The Appeal to Incredulity Fallacy is the dismissal of a proposition as false because it sounds unbelievable.,,,"For example, someone might think it is unbelievable that there is a free activity that can increase their lifespan, improve their physical and mental health, and improve their cognitive abilities. (But getting enough sleep each night is a free activity that does all of these things.)

Appeal to Motive Fallacy,,yes,The Appeal to Motive Fallacy is the claim an argument must be false because the person making it has biased or ulterior motives.,,,"For example: ""We can't trust the evidence that he produces because he'll sell millions of copies of his book if people believe that his theories are true.""","motive, intent, purpose, ulterior",2.

Appeal to Nature Fallacy,,yes,The Appeal to Nature Fallacy is the claim that natural things are automatically good and that synthetic things are automatically bad.,,,"For example: ""Vaccines are unnatural. Therefore, they are bad for me.""

Another example: ""Why would people make genetically-modified foods? Natural foods are already perfect!""","nature, natural, synthetic, man-made, manmade",2. Desires,"3. Intends, 5. Believes, 6. Chooses, 10. Maintains","To overcome this fallacy, provide counterexamples. If a beneficial behavior is seen as unnatural, provide evidence that it results in positive outcomes. If a detrimental behavior is seen as natural, provide evidence that it results in negative outcomes.

In some cases, this fallacy may be deeply connected to a person's worldview. If a person views humans as being a fundamentally different kind of thing than animals, then man-made things will take on a particularly significant quality that they would otherwise not have if the person were to view humans as merely being another kind of animal. For example, are skyscrapers ""natural""? If one views humans as just another kind of animal, then comparing skyscrapers to anthills might seem appropriate; but to a person who views humans as being metaphysically different than animals, such a comparison might seem degrading to humans or even simply absurd. In other words, if a person is a materialist who believes that nature is just ""everything that is,"" then skyscrapers and vaccines and sodas are just as ""natural"" as anthills and venom and honey. But a person who believes that humans are separate from nature will probably view man-made things with some amount of mistrust. And, of course, challenging a person's worldview is extremely difficult and likely to backfire. Offering counterexamples may still be the best course of action, but be aware that they may not be received warmly.

This fallacy may also represent a response to the facts that (1) we don't always test our inventions sufficiently well and (2) we are often motivated by profit to invent quickly. We've noticed that we have, in the past, rushed to invent products that later caused lots of damage, and that's made us skeptical about the benefits of new inventions. The concern that inventions be well-tested is valid and extremely important, but it's also separate from whether or not human inventions are ""natural.""",rhetorical fallacy,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/appeal_to_nature,,,,,,,,
Appeal to Novelty Fallacy,,yes,The Appeal to Novelty Fallacy is the belief that something is automatically better because it is new or newer.,,,"For example: ""The latest version of this operating system is going to make my computer faster and better.""","new, original, unique",2.

It might also help to point out that old things may more reliable, well-tested, and cheaper.

A within-subjects bias occurs when an individual displays greater bias toward one type of information (e.g., painful faces) when compared to different types of information (e.g., neutral faces). Alternatively, a between-subjects bias occurs when one group of participants displays greater bias than another group of participants (e.g., chronic pain patients showed greater bias towards painful expressions than did healthy control participants).",The second paragraph is partly from https://infogalactic.com/info/Attentional_bias but looks like it has already been reworded somewhat ,"For example, someone might be worried that their friend is angry with them, so they may pay extra close attention to the friend's facial expressions, looking for signs of annoyance.

Example #1: It is known that 1 in 10,000 people have a certain kind of cancer, and it is also known that a test for that kind of cancer performed on 10,000 people will yield 100 positives; therefore, the test has a false positive rate of 99 out of 10,000. If a doctor performs the test on a patient but fails to consider the test's false positive rate and only considers the rate of cancer in the general population, then she will very likely misdiagnose a positive result from the test as being true when it is much more likely that a positive result is false. 

Example #2: It is known that only a very small percentage of startups last longer than two years. Someone might be considering investing in a startup that seems to have been doing well during the two months that it has been running. They may be so impressed with the startup team that they are sure that it'll last longer than two years.

It may also be useful to point out when an argument containing this fallacy fails to explain a causal mechanism. In the example above about caffeine (""Caffeine makes people more alert because it's a stimulant.""), no causal mechanism has been described; the claim essentially boils down to: ""Caffeine stimulates because it's a stimulant.""

Conjunction Fallacy,,yes,"The Conjunction Fallacy is a logical reasoning fallacy wherein someone assigns a lower probability to an event occurring in general than to the event occurring in combination with another event (in ""conjunction"" with another event).","In one experiment, subjects were presented with the following scenario: Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright.

1. Linda is a bank teller.
2. Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.

85% of those asked chose option 2. However, the probability of two events occurring together (in ""conjunction"") is always less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring alone. But in another study, the question was rephrased in a more concrete format, and participants were likely to get the answer right. This demonstrates that it may be a result of poor word choice, rather than bias, that causes subjects to create unrealistic associations.","If we just wanted to give an overview of the historical origins of experiment demonstrations of this error, then it seems fine to just reword this.

One can also see this fallacy present in conspiracism (in addition to other fallacies), where proponents of a particular conspiracy believe that it's more likely that many outlandish events occurred than that a few mundane events occurred. For example, one common feature of conspiracism is the belief in a vast ""cover-up."" This requires one to believe that hundreds, thousands, or even millions of people cooperated to hide a highly significant event. While it's by no means impossible for a cover-up to have occurred, most people know enough about human nature to know that (1) humans have trouble cooperating on such a scale for an extended period of time and (2) that too many humans desire honesty and transparency for such an event to be hidden for long.

Context-dependent cues are dependent on the environment and situation. Memory retrieval can be facilitated or triggered by replication of the context in which the memory was encoded. Such conditions include weather, company, location, smelling a particular odor, hearing a certain song, and even taste can sometimes act as a cue. For example, students sometimes fail to recall diligently studied material when an examination room's environmental conditions differ significantly from the room or place where learning occurred.

The probability that *either* event (A or B) occurs will always be larger than the individual probabilities of A occurring or of B occurring.,"Further evidence that the Representativeness Heuristic may be causal to the Disjunction Fallacy comes from Bar-Hillel and Neter (1986). They found that people judge a person who is highly representative of being a statistics major (e.g., highly intelligent, does math competitions) as being more likely to be a statistics major than a social sciences major (superset of statistics), but they do not think that he is more likely to be a Hebrew language major than a humanities major (superset of Hebrew language). Thus, only when the person seems highly representative of a category is that category judged as more probable than its superordinate category. For example, the probability of being either a physics or a biology major is at least as likely as being a physics major, if not more likely. However, when a personality description (data) seems to be very representative of a physics major (e.g., pocket protector) over a biology major, people judge that it is more likely for this person to be a physics major than a natural sciences major (which is a superset of physics).

To overcome this bias, remind people that merely beginning a new, positive behavior may be more important than perfecting the actual implementation details.

Roughly, participants who found tasks to be relatively easy erroneously assumed, to some extent, that the tasks must also be easy for others.

Similar studies on European subjects show marked muting of the effect; studies on some East Asian subjects suggest that something like the opposite of the Dunning–Kruger effect operates on self-assessment and motivation to improve.

The hypothesis was confounded by the Fundamental Attribution Error.

Subjects in an experiment read essays for and against Fidel Castro. Then they were asked to rate the pro-Castro attitudes of the writers. When the subjects believed that the writers freely chose positions for or against Castro, they would normally rate the people who liked Castro as having a more positive attitude towards Castro. However, contradicting Jones and Harris' initial hypothesis, when the subjects were told that the writers' positions were determined by a coin toss, they still rated writers who spoke in favor of Castro as having, on average, a more positive attitude towards Castro than those who spoke against him. In other words, the subjects were unable to properly see the influence of the situational constraints placed upon the writers; they could not refrain from attributing sincere belief to the writers. The experimental group provided more internal attributions towards the writer. ",,"For example: ""Rhonda was able to quit smoking.

Therefore, people may not consider other important barriers and enablers to their behavior change efforts, such as those in their physical and social environment.

The results revealed that the staff had overestimated the number of female seniority staff and underestimated the number of male senior staff.

Beyond that, there is some degree of uncertainty in almost every statement. It might also help to practice fostering epistemic humility.

Optimism Bias could be an important factor to keep in mind, both for the person changing their behavior and anyone supporting them in doing so, at every stage of behavior change (from the planning through to implementation and maintenance of the behavior). It has the potential to either be helpful or counterproductive to behavior change, depending on how unrealistic it is and depending on what the optimism pertains to. For example, the tendency to persist in the face of challenges (which could be seen as a form of behavioral optimism) appears to be predicted by a person's level of intellectual humility ([Porter et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1041608020300686?casa_token=sJNl4ThLbWUAAAAA:E8U8KRkr11qvyWjYzRoIIiR8SaC_J2L9rML1N-a1qBt0CgNVIEPjWli410B7hb0ONUG7HtQ8x-8)). If intellectual humility is a quality that can be nurtured or encouraged, then this might represent an attractive way to encourage people to persist in the face of challenges (behavioral optimism), without encouraging them to become overconfident. 


Optimism Bias can also interact with the Observer-expectancy Effect and the placebo effect. Having optimistic expectations in and of themselves could increase the probability that the person performs better than they would have (had their expectations been lower). This may be desirable as long as the person is aware of the bias and as long as the person's expectations are not so high as to be unrealistic. However, it is also worth keeping in mind that encouragement is only one factor that could influence the degree of Optimism Bias someone experiences; it may also be driven by their own personal characteristics and health conditions. 

To attempt to overcome Optimism Bias in cases where it is excessive or is counterproductively influencing someone's behavior, it might help to point this out. It may also help to generate more realistic expectations regarding positive and negative outcomes of their behavior change efforts.

The evolutionary advantages of being able to identify friend from foe with split-second accuracy are numerous.

This might mean that people are more likely to desire, remember, and choose to engage in and continue the behavior when they encounter opportunities to do so. If the information presented also assists people in planning how exactly to start the behavior, then it could also help with the intention stage.

They might only have a 25% chance of gaining entry to either of the options, but they need to decide in advance which of the two they want to apply for: a strictly-structured course or a self-paced one (that would allow them to learn 1.5 times as much material overall). Suppose they believe that by doing the strictly-structured one, they can be ~100% sure to learn the skill by a specific date; on the other hand, they predict only an 80% chance of engaging in the course material associated with the alternative, self-paced course.

Such a reaction can cause people to adopt or strengthen views that contradict the imposed rules.,"[first two sentences here are taken from description column: There are four important elements to reactance theory: perceived freedom, threat to freedom, reactance, and restoration of freedom. Freedom is not an abstract consideration, but rather a feeling associated with real behaviors, including actions, emotions, and attitudes. ] One study concluded that one way to increase the activity of a threatened freedom is to censor it, or provide a threatening message toward the activity. In turn a ""boomerang effect"" occurs, in which people choose forbidden alternatives. This study also shows that social influence has better results when it does not threaten one's core freedoms. Two concepts revealed in this study are that a communicator may be able to increase the positive force toward compliance by increasing his or her credibility, and that increasing the positive communication force and decreasing the negative communication force simultaneously should increase compliance.","This would need rewording and since it doesn't specify the particular studies I'd probably want to go find the studies it was citing.

The other intervention plan would save an expected 5,000 lives, but entailed a full vaccination coverage in one nation (from 4,000 to 0 deaths, so zero risk of death from that disease in that country) and a partial vaccination coverage in the other nation (from 8,000 to 7,000 in that country).
