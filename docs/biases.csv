Also, ask people to develop mnemonic devices or other kinds of memory triggers to remember to perform the relevant actions.

Actor-Observer Asymmetry,,"The Actor-Observer Asymmetry occurs when people subconsciously change the way they attribute behavior to various factors depending on whether they're the person performing the behavior (the *actor*) or a witness to the behavior from the outside (an *observer*). When assessing their own behavior as actors, people tend to emphasize the influence of the situation on their behavior and downplay the influence of their own personality or character. When assessing others' behavior as observers, the reverse is true: people's assessment of others' behavior tends to emphasize the influence of personality or character in the behavior and downplay the influence of the situation.","This has been demonstrated in studies by differentiating between actors' and observers' explanations in the following way: people's explanations were separated into theoretically meaningful distinctions (e.g., reasons vs. causal history of reason explanations). The responses were categorized, and the differences emerged.","For example: ""I haven't been able to get into the habit of going to the gym because life has just been so busy right now! Every day, I go to work, then come home and spend a few minutes with my kids and spouse, then cook dinner, then work on remodelling our back porch. I just don't have time to go to the gym!

This could be aided by providing some counterexamples (e.g., providing examples of people who don't smoke and still love parties).

Considers, 2. Desires, 3. Intends, 5. Believes, 6. Chooses","Pointing out this fallacy directly might have the potential to backfire, since this kind of reasoning can be associated with cognitive dissonance and motivated reasoning, which may decrease the degree to which people can engage rationally and productively with information and/or arguments contradicting their current thinking (e.g., [Rothgerber, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666319306324?casa_token=TbOa-8zyVboAAAAA:pwCeOrthXBA3hSOV8dSmUNyL5cIT4oeSJV3jYRNd5wCSseAtLw4rvD0cYYRU6VZRhBohasvyO7Y)). 

Motivated reasoning may become particularly problematic when the topic at hand is framed in moral terms (as topics framed in terms of morality can be associated with more polarization than those perceived through a pragmatic lens; [Abeywickrama et al., 2020](https://jspp.psychopen.eu/index.php/jspp/article/view/5263)). Having said that, given the right circumstances and the right person, it might sometimes be worth telling someone when it seems like this fallacy is affecting their reasoning (if the backfire risk is judged to be sufficiently low). 

It is especially important to approach this reasoning fallacy strategically in cases where it affects someone's perceptions about the rationale for, intention to engage in, and beliefs about the feasibility and consequences of a desired behavior. This may be worth taking into consideration when raising initial awareness of a behavior or its consequences: if the target audience has certain ideas that they hold strongly, and value highly, then it could backfire to convey information that directly challenges those beliefs. And when information _is_ presented that _could_ contradict someone's cherished beliefs, it might be preferable to share the information on its own - without sharing the conclusions or providing behavioral prescriptions - in order to encourage the person to come to their _own_ conclusions (which could also leverage the Generation Effect). 

Over the longer-term, it may help to encourage people to foster more epistemic humility, potentially through practicing dialogic argumentation in a wide variety of contexts ([Kuhn & Crowell, 2011](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797611402512?casa_token=j8n-fvNZXIcAAAAA%3ARQxwCnHBeC4V_rEOge0_-zqCBENDDml05g1n502cs7OTa8ADJ2pONhY88bhP2p3CHRm0C7RA6-lsww)). More research in this area is needed, but some evidence suggests that such approaches may enable people to become less attached to their desired conclusions ([Švaříček, 2019](https://www.phil.muni.cz/journals/index.php/studia-paedagogica/article/view/2063), which may increase their ability to form more realistic beliefs through the use of reasoning and evidence.",,rhetorical fallacy,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/appeal_to_consequences,,,,,,

The way in which this is addressed may depend on how severe the person's fear is, and how strongly they hold their current beliefs relating to the feared outcome(s).

The probability that *either* event occurs will be larger than the individual probabilities of A occuring or of B occuring. When someone believes that the probability of one of the individual events somehow exceeds the probability of the disjunction of those events, they have fallen prey to the Disjunction Fallacy.  ","Further evidence that the Representativeness Heuristic may be causal to the Disjunction Fallacy comes from Bar-Hillel and Neter (1986).

For example, regularly practicing mindfulness meditation has been shown in multiple studies to produce mental health benefits, but this does not imply that regular mindfulness meditation would benefit everyone (and there are some subpopulations with mental health concerns that might preclude them from some of the benefits, e.g., people with dissociative identity disorder or a history of trauma might in some cases be harmed rather than helped by some of the states induced by mindfulness meditation). Those people may then be disappointed or actively harmed in their attempt to start and continue a behavior that is being recommended to the general population (unless they adapt the behavior and their way of enacting it to suit their particular needs).",,logical fallacy,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fallacy_of_composition,,,,,,

This can either lead a person to believe that his opinions are shared by the majority, or, even if he is aware that they are not shared by the majority, he will overestimate the number of people with whom he shares the opinion. Additionally, when confronted with evidence that a consensus does not exist, people often assume that those who do not agree with them are defective in some way.

This bias can be traced back to primarily two roots. According to social comparison, individuals evaluate their thoughts and attitudes based on other people, and often look towards others to find a ""norm"" by which they may judge themselves.

This effect is interesting to psychologists because it appears to be a reversal of the otherwise pervasive effects of confirmation bias.

For example, one might want to share a pubic reminder of the importance of vaccinations. For some populations of people, sharing such a reminder via the media may be acceptable, while for other, more polarized/strongly-partisan subpopulations, it may be preferable to find alternative ways of engaging with them and of encouraging them to consider the advantages of vaccinations (e.g., such as by engaging with their social networks, finding people who are open to changing their mind, and then to discussing their belief updates with their peers).",,cognitive bias,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostile_media_effect,,,,,,

To investigate perceptions of control, experimenters may ask people about hypothetical situations, for example the likelihood of their involvement in a motor vehicle accident. On average, drivers regard accidents as much less likely in ""high-control"" situations, such as when they are driving, than in ""low-control"" situations, such as when they are in the passenger seat. They also rate a high-control accident, such as driving into the car in front, as much less likely than a low-control accident such as being hit from behind by another driver.","For example, someone who currently lives a sedentary lifestyle, but who aspires to rapidly increase their activity levels, may overestimate the degree to which they have control over whether they will be able to prepare to run a marathon within the the next four weeks: they may overlook the fact that it takes longer than four weeks to prepare for a marathon, and they do not have control over their physiological responses to their training, nor do they have complete control over their susceptibility to joint overuse and ligamentous strain-related injuries.","illusion, control, events, estimate","2.

The results revealed that the staff had overestimated the number of female seniority staff and underestimated the number of male senior staff.

It was found that all four groups evaluated their performance as above average, meaning that the lowest-scoring group (the bottom 25%) showed a very large Illusory Superiority Bias.

Whether a transaction is framed as a loss or a gain is very important: would you rather get a $5 discount (win), or avoid a $5 surcharge (loss)?

The Ludic Fallacy could cause people to prematurely stop searching for information about how to complete the behavior (thus affecting the degree to which they meet the ""Knows"" condition), and/or could cause them to prematurely stop searching for ways to make their environment more conducive to their desired behavior(s), because they conclude that they know everything there is to know about the situation. They may believe, for example, that it is impossible to improve the environmental conditions (e.g., such that the environment would increase their success in starting and continuing the behavior). The same fallacy may also cause someone to assume that they should give up trying or maintaining the behavior for other reasons, and to be too sure about this conclusion (without acknowledging key uncertainties). A longer-term solution to this tendency might be to encourage the person to practice probabilistic thinking, with particular attention being paid to estimating their level of uncertainty in every belief that they form. (For example, they could note that, although they can be sure that they are currently having thoughts [if they are thinking about this idea, then they must be thinking], this is probably the only thing they can really be sure about, and beyond that, that there is some degree of uncertainty in almost every statement).

It has been documented to be a persistent tendency in healthy adults (ref), and it has the potential to either be helpful or counterproductive to behavior change, depending on how unrealistic it is and depending on what the optimism pertains to. For example, the tendency to persist in the face of challenges (which could be seen as a form of behavioral optimism) appears to be predicted by a person's level of intellectual humility ([Porter et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1041608020300686?casa_token=sJNl4ThLbWUAAAAA:E8U8KRkr11qvyWjYzRoIIiR8SaC_J2L9rML1N-a1qBt0CgNVIEPjWli410B7hb0ONUG7HtQ8x-8)). If intellectual humility is a quality that can be nurtured or encouraged, then this might represent an attractive way to encourage people to persist in the face of challenges (behavioral optimism), without encouraging them to become overconfident. 

Optimism bias can also interact with the Observer-expectancy Effect and the placebo effect. As long as the person being encouraged is aware of the biased nature of this reasoning (and is therefore not being misled as to the intentions behind such encouragement), and as long as the person's expectations are not so high as to be unrealistic, having optimistic expectations in and of themselves could increase the probability that the person performs better than they would have (had their expectations been lower). For example, if you think that there is a 75% probability that three months from now, your friend will be engaging in moderate-intensity physical activity for between 20 and 150 minutes per week, and their goal is to do that for at least 120 minutes per week,  reminding them that they *can* do it would be both true and encouraging, and may help them to feel more optimistic about their chances of success (compared to e.g., reminding them that there's also a decent chance that they could fall well short of their goal). However, it is also worth keeping in mind that encouragement is only one factor that could influence the degree of optimism bias someone experiences; it may also be driven by their own personal characteristics and health conditions, including whether they have depression (which has been documented to decrease or even reverse this bias, to the detriment of the person's wellbeing [todo: ref]). 

There are also cases were optimism bias could be excessive, to the point of causing the person to form unrealistic ideas about their abilities or about the best ways of implementing and continuing the behavior; in such cases, a benevolent helper could help the person to adjust their beliefs, by clearly explaining the actual probability of success in engaging in behavior change in similar scenarios, and by helping people to think about the probabilities of negative outcomes, and plans for responding to them.

The surgery had a known probability of success. Subjects were presented with either a good or bad outcome (in this case living or dying), and asked to rate the quality of the surgeon's pre-operation decision. Those presented with bad outcomes rated the decision worse than those who were presented with good outcomes.","For example, someone may plan to progress through a series of steps that should culminate in the establishment of a new, positive habit.

Overconfidence has been studied in three different ways: 1. Overestimation of one's performance, ability, level of control, or rate of work; 2. An inflated belief that one is better than others, or overplacement; and 3. An excessive belief in the truth and accuracy of one’s beliefs, or overprecision. One is example is shown in a spelling task, where subjects were correct about 80% of the time when they were ""100% certain.""

If the person is equipped with this knowledge and takes it into consideration, this may enable them to set more realistic expectations and goals, which might increase the chance that they remain motivated to continue improving their skills over time and to maintain the behavior over time.

Pareidolia is why we find a ""face"" when we look at two dots and a line arranged inside of a circle.

Carl Sagan hypothesized that as a survival technique, human beings are ""hard-wired"" from birth to identify the human face. This allows people to use only minimal details to recognize faces from a distance and in poor visibility, but can also lead them to interpret random images or patterns of light and shade as being faces. The evolutionary advantages of being able to identify friend from foe with split-second accuracy are numerous. For example, prehistoric (and even modern) men and women who accidentally identify an enemy as a friend could face deadly consequences for this mistake.

Additionally, success may be more readily available to memory than failure.","For example, someone may attribute their failure to engage in a desired behavior change (such as failure to engage in five 30-minute sessions of aerobic exercise per week as they had originally planned) to external factors (such as work commitments, family commitments, weather conditions, etc.), rather than acknowledging that internal factors (such as time management, motivation levels, and procrastination) may also have contributed to the failed implementation of behavior.","attribute, ascribe, success, failure, personality, character, situation","2.

In cases where this illusion is counterproductive, a benevolent helper could point out the other factors that can contribute to specific outcomes (beyond the factors within the person's control). This bias might cause people to think that a given behavior change is more under their control than it is in reality, which could cause them to desire the behavior change more (meeting the ""Desires"" condition) or to believe that specific actions they take will lead to specific positive outcomes (meeting the ""Believes"" condition), as well as feeling more accomplished than they otherwise would in situations where they succeed at starting or continuing the behavior (which could be motivating). On the other hand, this bias could also cause people to feel that a failure to engage in or to continue a behavior was less related to their own actions (or inactions) than it was in reality. This may lead them to overlook some of the ways in which their behavior could be optimized in the future, which might decrease their probability of successful behavior change over the longer-term.

The term ""stereotype"" derives from the Greek words στερεός (stereos), meaning ""firm, solid"", and τύπος (typos), meaning ""impression,"" hence: ""solid impression"". It was originally a term used in the world of printing to describe a duplicate impression of an original typographical element, used for printing instead of the original.

There are many theories about why individuals tend to stereotype. One theory is that stereotyping is the most convenient way to sort information - grouping large numbers of people and experiences together. It could also be the case that one's childhood experiences are primary in the creation of stereotypes, and these stereotypes learned in childhood are self-perpetuating, growing stronger as an individual ages. A third theory focuses on an individual's need to feel good about him or herself. If I am part of Group A, and Group A is ""right"" about everything, then it is best for my self esteem to lump other individuals into separate, inferior groups.",,,"stereotype, group, member, individual, characteristics","1.

In cases where the backfire risk is deemed to be sufficiently low, it may be worth encouraging the person to practice actively considering the reasons that arguments in opposition to their own could actually turn out to be true. An example of this could be trying to find the best ways of supporting an opposing argument, which can be called ""steel-manning"" the argument ([Mattes, 2020](https://search.informit.com.au/fullText;dn=077923104428244;res=IELENG)).

Even if the employment of the Straw Man Fallacy was not actively dissuading someone from positive behavior change in the present moment, it could be argued that it would be worth trying to reduce tendency in the longer-term.

In cases where this tendency is counterproductive, a benevolent helper could point out this fallacy and/or could encourage someone to systematically estimate the probabilities of important possible outcomes in ways that are less susceptible to subadditivity. For example, when a person is estimating the probability of positive outcomes from behavior change (e.g., when considering whether or how much they desire a behavior change), or when they are estimating the probability of failure (when deciding how to plan for success, and how to respond to failure when it does occur), then subadditivity may cause them to underestimate the overall probability of the outcome category (compared to if they added up the individual mutually exclusive events that together would form the overall category). So, rather than estimating the probability of the _overall_ categories of outcomes, it would be preferable to first estimate the probabilities of individual outcomes, and _then_ to use those probability estimates to derive estimates of the probabilities of overall categories.

Defense of the status quo can also occur when people haven't imagined the alternatives vividly enough. For example, calls to ""defund the police"" often cause people to imagine a society in chaos and collapse, and thus to continue funding the police; so opponents of police funding may have to work extra hard to help the public to imagine what a society could look like if less money was spent on policing and more money was spent on education, social services, and healthcare.",,cognitive bias,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_justification,,,,,,

The results of Duncan's study demonstrates that ultimate attribution error is more likely to occur when there are negative associations with members of an out-group due to previous conflict or certain situations that were experienced (Whitley & Kite, 2010).","For example, someone may view negative acts committed by outgroup members (e.g., taking the last biscuit from a plate at a group morning tea) as being representative of a stable personality trait (e.g., they may label an outgroup member as greedy), and may view positive acts committed by outgroup members (e.g., bringing more than their share of homemade food to a group morning tea) as being attributable to other causes (e.g., they may assume someone in the outgroup brought large quantities of homemade food simply because they had a lot of ingredients available already, and had lots of spare time that week).

Unit Bias,,Unit Bias refers to a preference for finishing a given unit of a task or an item.,,"For example, someone may prefer to finish a whole packet (unit) of chips once they have opened them. Another example may arise if someone bought a six-pack of beer to share with a friend, for instance. The pair may drink two beers each and may be satisfied, but may then decide that they would prefer to finish the whole pack (in which case the unit bias would encourage them to drink more than they otherwise would). ","unit, prefer, finish, task, item",,6. Chooses,"Change the unit size (e.g., reduce the portion size for food, break the task into smaller subtasks, etc.).

Wishful Thinking,,"Wishful Thinking refers to belief formation and decision-making that is based on what one desires (rather than appealing to evidence, rationality or reality).

Zeigarnik Effect in Memory,,"The Zeigarnik Effect is named after Bluma Zeigarnik, whose dissertation studied the tendency for people to remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks. (note to self - probably need to come back to this row to see whether 'experimental evidence' column should be added to - as subsequent experiments have shown mixed results)","Soviet psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik first studied the phenomenon after her professor, Gestalt psychologist Kurt Lewin, noticed that a waiter had better recollections of still unpaid orders. In Gestalt psychology, the Zeigarnik effect has been used to demonstrate the general presence of Gestalt phenomena: not just appearing as perceptual effects, but also present in cognition. The Zeigarnik effect suggests that students who ""suspend"" their study, during which they do unrelated activities (such as studying unrelated subjects or playing games), will remember material better than students who complete study sessions without a break (Zeigarnik, 1927; McKinney 1935).",,"interrupt, incomplete, task, remember, memory",,7.

Zero-risk Bias,,"Zero-risk Bias refers to the cognitive bias favoring opportunities to eliminate rather than mitigate a risk. For a minority of people, when there are multiple possible courses of action, some of which involve complete elimination of a subcategory of risk, and others of which do not, this bias can cause people to irrationally favor options including complete elimination of a subcategory of risk, even if other options come with a greater absolute reduction in risk overall. ","This bias has been demonstrated in multiple studies, with its probability of affecting decision-making appearing to depend on the decision-making context and framing (e.g., [Schneider et al., 2017](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-30652-004?casa_token=DoeNW5Pr_h4AAAAA:x2ARETOKfbu36oNRrcd8dgznUGeHhOi5y-XfpqkBuHZ6Ijq7OZy0sUZsk_onyEH3B1idwdM36R9yEdr8XN81p_6F); [Raue & Schneider, 2019](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-11456-5_5)). In one recent study ([Cantarelli, Belle & Belardinelli, 2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0734371X18778090?casa_token=SuOajn6vVvgAAAAA%3A-f8cxnU1B4lplrwGne2UrBwLTS6UVgwcmN1kd3J6UimijTGMaq-ZvuzOcmlwIda0g7QXQiw4KPUhuA)), 495 nurses were given a scenario where they were told that an infectious disease had broken out in two developing countries, and that the doses of the perfectly effective vaccination were limited. One intervention plan would save an expected 6,000 lives via partial vaccination coverage in both nations: this plan would reduce deaths from 8,000 to 4,000 in one country and from 4,000 to 2,000 in the other country. The other intervention plan would save an expected 5,000 lives, but entailed a full vaccination coverage in one nation (from 4,000 to 0 deaths,  so zero risk of death from that disease in that country) and a partial vaccination coverage in the other nation (from 8,000 to 7,000 in that country). Approximately 29% of the sample appeared to be affected by zero-risk bias, favoring the scenario that involved complete elimination of risk in one of the countries, despite that option saving 1,000 fewer lives overall. ","This bias could affect public health decision-making, such as in the way described in the study results above. It could also affect an individual person's decision-making. For example, someone who is attempting to decrease the environmental harms associated with their lifestyle might focus on completely eliminating their use of plastic straws (because this would reduce their production of plastic straw waste to zero), while neglecting other actions that they could take to reduce the harm they produce to a much greater degree (even though risks in other categories couldn't be reduced to zero, and might not be able to be estimated precisely).","zero, risk, safe, eliminate, mitigate, small, large","2. Desires, 3. Intends, 6. Chooses, 10. Maintains",2. Desires,"In some cases, this bias might encourage positive behaviors or discourage negative ones, in which case it might not need to be rectified. For example, a person recovering from alcoholism might opt to ban themselves from ever having alcohol, because they would prefer to have zero risk of recidivism. However, the bias could also distort the way in which someone reasons about the relative importance of different behavioral possibilities and outcomes, which might change how they choose, plan for, implement and maintain behavior changes. For example, someone who is attempting to decrease the environmental harms associated with their lifestyle might focus on completely eliminating their use of plastic straws (because this would reduce their production of plastic straw waste to zero), while neglecting other actions that they could take to reduce the harm they produce to a much greater degree (even though risks in other categories couldn't be reduced to zero, and might not be able to be estimated precisely). In such situations, a possible solution could be to make the person aware of the possibility that their choices of behavior change strategies might be influenced by this bias. Over the longer-term, it might be helpful to encourage people to practice probabilistic reasoning, potentially including writing down the estimated risks associated with each of the possible outcomes/choices, along with the predicted risks following different actions. They may find that they were focusing on eliminating a specific type of risk, but that there are other risks they could be focusing on instead, which would be associated with much greater expected risk reductions (despite being associated with uncertainty).",,cognitive bias,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-risk_bias,,,"Imagine that you suffer from terrible migraine headaches, and you have a choice of taking one of two new medicines, Medicine A or Medicine B, both of which will completely eliminate your migraines. However, Medicine A has causes side effect X in 1 out of every 25 people and side effect Y in 1 out of every 10 people, though it can never cause both side effects in one person. Medicine B causes side effect X in 1 out of every 5 people, but does not cause side effect Y in anyone. Assuming that you believe side effects X and Y to be equally undesirable, which medicine do you take?","If I did the math correctly, there is a 13.6% chance of experiencing a side effect with medicine A, and a 20% chance of experiencing a side effect with medicine B. I'm not confident that this question would test the zero-risk bias as much as one's (in)ability to properly compute probabilities.",,
