"""After This, Therefore Because of This"" Fallacy (Post Hoc, Ergo Propter Hoc)","This fallacy occurs when a person assumes that event A caused event B because B occurred after A.

(Self) Generation Effect in Memory,"The Generation Effect refers to the robust finding that information will be better remembered if it is generated rather than simply read. For example, you are more likely to remember the word ""orangutan"" if you generate it from the fragment ""or_ng_ta_"" than if you simply see the word in its entirety.

The Generation Effect is usually achieved in cognitive psychology experiments where participants are asked to generate words from word fragments. It has also been demonstrated using a variety of other materials, such as when generating a word after being presented with its antonym or synonym, or generating keywords in paragraphs, pictures, and arithmetic problems. In addition, the generation effect has been found in studies using free recall, cued recall, and recognition tests.",memory bias,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_effect,,,,,,,,,,"3. Intends, 4. Remembers","To leverage this bias, encourage people come to conclusions for themselves instead of handing them a fully-formed train of thought. For example, encourage someone to start giving to charity by asking them questions that challenge them to think about their values and about ways in which they are or aren't acting in accordance with those values. Also, ask people to develop mnemonic devices or other kinds of memory triggers to remember to perform the relevant actions. For example, if someone is trying to manage their anger, they could come up with the acronym ""CAT,"" which stands for ""Controlling Anger Today,"" and ask them to post the acronym somewhere they'll see it often or to repeat it often as a kind of mantra.",
Actor-observer Asymmetry,"Actors, those assessing their own behavior, tend to emphasize the influence of the situation and the situation's effect on their behavior, and underemphasize the influence of their own character. When observing others' actions, observers tend to emphasize aspects of behavior and personality, and how those characteristics lead to a behavior, rather than the situation's influence.

This has been demonstrated in studies by differentiating between actors' and observers' explanations in the following way: people's explanations are separated into theoretically meaningful distinctions (e.g., reasons vs. causal history of reason explanations). Then responses can be effectively categorized, and the differences emerge.",cognitive bias,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor%E2%80%93observer_bias,,,,,,,,,,"3. Intends, 5. Believes, 10. Maintains","To overcome this bias, ask people to consider how a friend, loved one, or ideal person would've behaved in the same situation. For example, if a person skipped gym day because it was raining really hard that day, ask them whether or not their gym buddy also skipped that day because of the rain. By comparing their actions against other people in identical situations, they can see that the context was less relevant than they supposed and that their character was more relevant than they supposed.",
Ad Hoc Rescue,"Trying to save a cherished belief by repeatedly revising the argument to explain away problems.

""But apart from better sanitation, medicine, education, irrigation, public health, roads, a freshwater system and public order.. What have the Romans done for us?"" ",rhetorical fallacy,,,,,,,,,,,2. Desires,"To overcome this bias, show people facts. For example, if you'd like to encourage someone to start giving to charity but they keep coming up with new reasons why giving to charity is useless or bad (e.g., social darwinism is morally good, poor people are poor because they're bad managers of their resources, everyone should pull themselves up by their own bootstraps, nonprofit organizations only pass along a small percentage of donations to poor people, etc.), then you could show them statistics about how giving to charity pulls more people out of poverty than other solutions do. Of course, this assumes that they share the same values as you but believe other strategies are more effective. If they don't even share the same values, a more philosophical argument may be required. (Honestly, though, it may not be possible to overcome this bias; some people are committed to their beliefs regardless of evidence or argument, so your time may be better spent elsewhere.)",

For example, someone might reason that ""people who take smoking breaks at work"" are not a subset of ""people who never take any breaks at work"", and ""people who never take any breaks at work"" are not a subset of ""people who have a healthy work-life balance""; they may then reach the erroneous conclusion that ""people who take smoking breaks at work have a healthy work-life balance"". One way to correct them might be to point out this reasoning fallacy. (However, it might be simpler and/or easier to simply point out counterexamples showing them that their conclusion is inaccurate, such as examples of people who take smoking breaks but who have to consistently stay later at work [and have to cut down on evening social events], due to their smoking breaks interrupting their workflow.)",
Affirming a Disjunct Fallacy,"A or B. 
A. 
Therefore not B.

The fallacy lies in concluding that one disjunct must be false because the other disjunct is true; in fact they may both be true. This results from ""or"" being defined inclusively rather than exclusively.

For example, someone might believe that either ""you stop smoking socially at parties"" OR ""you keep enjoying parties"", without realising that the two are not mutually exclusive categories, and it is actually possible to stop smoking socially at parties while still enjoying them. A benevolent helper could respectfully point out the fallacy inherent in affirming a disjunct in this case. This could be aided by providing some counterexamples (e.g. providing examples of people who don't smoke and still love parties). Another way in which this fallacy could negatively influence behavior change would be when people draw incorrect conclusions regarding the resources and other requirements for performing or for continuing a particular action: for example, they may believe that either ""you don't have a gym membership"" (A) OR ""you have the ability to meet your recommended levels of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise each week"" (B), without realising that A does not preclude B (i.e. if A applies, it doesn't mean that B can't apply). If they engage in this kind of reasoning, it may lead them to believe that they don't have the required resources to increase their physical activity levels. Respectfully pointing out that they are engaging in this kind of reasoning, and/or providing counterexamples (such as their ability to start jogging or cycling for no or little cost [depending on shoes/cycling equipment]) may help in cases like these.",

For example, if someone sees that their friends who have gym memberships are physically fit, they may assume that anyone who is physically fit must have a gym membership. If the person in question can't afford a gym membership or doesn't like the thought of using a gym during a pandemic, then it could be quite counterproductive for them to erroneously conclude that if they want to be fit, then they will need a gym membership (as this would give them the impression that increasing their level of physical fitness is an unattainable goal merely because they can't join a gym). This could be addressed by identifying counterexamples (e.g. drawing on examples of people who are physically fit who regularly engage in low-cost exercise outside of the gym).",
Ambiguity Effect,"A cognitive bias where decision making is affected by a lack of information, or ""ambiguity"". The effect implies that people tend to select options for which the probability of a favorable outcome is known, instead of an option for which the probability of a favorable outcome is unknown.

Anchoring Bias (see Focusing Effect),"A person's expectation about one thing is affected by something he/she saw, heard, or thought before. This occurs when people rely too heavily on a specific piece of information to govern their thought-process. 

In one study, an audience was asked to write the last two digits of their social security number and consider whether they would pay this number of dollars for items such as wine, chocolate, and computer equipment, the value of which they did not know. They were then asked to bid for these items. The result was that the audience members with higher two-digit numbers would submit bids that were between 60 percent and 120 percent higher than those with the lower social security numbers. Put simply, the higher the (social security) number in mind, the higher the bid. The social security numbers had become their ""anchors"".",cognitive bias,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring,Q,"You're buying an expensive piece of software for your company.

On all tests, have a question asking how much money one considers to be ""expensive"" for a hamburger.

The 2 games would have to be similar in that it would be irrational for a person to be more risk averse in one than another, but they'd have to be different in way that prevented the test taker from realizing this. Also must be careful that a subject's different answers don't result from the framing bias, rather than the anchoring bias.",Focal Bias,The Cognitive Miser,"2. Desires, 3.

In other words, a population represents many individuals, but a single individual does not necessarily represent the population (since it's possible to tell a true anecdote that's nevertheless statistically rare for a population).

Apeal to Novelty Fallacy,"Supposing something is better because it is new or newer.

""Awesome! The latest version of this operating system is going to make my computer faster and better..""",rhetorical fallacy,rhetological fallacies spreadsheet,,,,,,,,,,2. Desires,"To overcome this fallacy, point out that there are significant (but often less noticeable) risks and costs associated with always having / using the newest thing. For example, trying to incorporate the latest trends in exercise requires continually learning new skills; and trying to eat in accordance with the latest diet trends puts one's health at risk since there may be little research into the long-term effects of the diet. Point out that old things may be less fashionable but are also more reliable, well-tested, and often cheaper.

To leverage this fallacy, show that the target behavior can be adopted in a new way. For example, to convince people to stop smoking cigarettes (which is not a new idea), show them new techniques and tools for quitting, such as a new medication or a new kind of chewing gum.",
Appeal to Authority Fallacy,"Arguing that a statement is correct because the statement is made by a person or source that is commonly regarded as authoritative.

Appeal to Consequences Fallacy,"An argument that concludes a premise (typically a belief) to be either true or false based on whether the premise leads to desirable or undesirable consequences.

""You're theory cannot possibly be true, as if it were, our lives would be meaningless."" Another example: someone may ignore or downplay the importance of the reasons that their behavior should change, or may ignore or dismiss the ways in which it would actually be feasible (avoiding setting intentions by perceiving it as impossible or not practical/feasible), because acknolwedging those reasons or possibilities would then require them to accept the justificiation for engaging in (potentially effortful and/or subjectively unpleasant) behavior change.",rhetorical fallacy,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/appeal_to_consequences,,,,,,,,,,"2. Desires, 3. Intends, 5. Believes, 6.

Motivated reasoning may become particularly problematic when the topic at hand is framed in moral terms (as topics framed in terms of morality can be associated with more polarization than those perceived through a pragmatic lens;[ Abeywickrama et al., 2020](https://jspp.psychopen.eu/index.php/jspp/article/view/5263)). Having said that, given the right circumstances and the right person, it might sometimes be worth pointing out to someone when this fallacy is affecting their reasoning (if the backfire risk is judged to be sufficiently low). It is especially important to approach this reasoning fallacy strategically in cases where it affects someone's perceptions about the rationale for, intention to engage in, and beliefs about the feasibility and consequences of a desired behavior. It might be preferable to share information on its own, without sharing the conclusions or providing behavioral prescriptions, in order to encourage the person to come to their own conclusions (which could also leverage the aforementioned Generation Effect). Furthermore, although this is not a rapid solution, over the longer-term, it may help to encourage people to foster more epistemic humility, potentially through practicing dialogic argumentation in a wide variety of contexts ([Kuhn & Crowell, 2011](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797611402512?casa_token=j8n-fvNZXIcAAAAA%3ARQxwCnHBeC4V_rEOge0_-zqCBENDDml05g1n502cs7OTa8ADJ2pONhY88bhP2p3CHRm0C7RA6-lsww)); more research in this area is needed, but some eivdence suggests that such approaches may enable people to become less attached to their desired conclusions ([Švaříček, 2019](https://www.phil.muni.cz/journals/index.php/studia-paedagogica/article/view/2063), which may enable them to better make use of reasoning and evidence to develop more realistic beliefs.",

Attentional Bias,"Some information or evidence may hold a disproportionate amount of a person's attention because of that person's environment, and emotionally stimulating events/items within it.

In studies using the dot-probe paradigm, patients who suffered from chronic ailments such as anxiety were more likely to focus on information or stimuli representing their concerns (in the case of anxiety: worried facial expressions).

 A 'within-subjects' bias occurs when an individual displays greater bias toward one type of information (e.g., painful faces) when compared to different types of information (e.g., neutral faces). Alternatively, a 'between-subjects' bias, occurs when one group of participants displays greater bias than another group of participants (e.g., chronic pain patients showed greater bias towards painful expressions than did healthy control participants).",cognitive bias,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attentional_Bias,Problematic description -- check it and revise it,"You're worried that your friend doesn't enjoy talking to you that much, so you pay extra close attention to her facial expressions, looking for signs of boredom or annoyance.

Base Rate Neglect,"Base Rate Neglect, or Base Rate Fallacy or Bias, is an error that occurs when the conditional probability of some hypothesis H, given some evidence E, is assessed without taking into account the ""base rate"" or ""prior probability"" of H and the total probability of evidence E.

When given relevant statistics about GPA distribution, students tended to ignore them if given descriptive information about the particular student, even if the new descriptive information was obviously of little or no relevance to school performance. 

Psychologists attempted to explain this finding in terms of the Representativeness Heuristic.

If a doctor performs the test on a patient but fails to consider the background information (that 1 in 10,000 people have that kind of cancer) and only considers the information provided by the test (that 100 in 10,000 people have that kind of cancer), then she will very likely misdiagnose a positive result from the test as being true when it is much more likely that a positive result is false.

Disjunction Fallacy,"The use of the Representativeness Heuristic may lead to a Disjunction Fallacy. From probability theory, the disjunction of two events is at least as likely as either of the events individually. For example, the probability of being either a physics or a biology major is at least as likely as being a physics major, if not more likely. However, when a personality description (data) seems to be very representative of a physics major (e.g., pocket protector) over a biology major, people judge that it is more likely for this person to be a physics major than a natural sciences major (which is a superset of physics).

Further evidence that the Representativeness Heuristic may be causal to the Disjunction Fallacy comes from Bar-Hillel and Neter (1986). They found that people judge a person who is highly representative of being a statistics major (e.g., highly intelligent, does math competitions) as being more likely to be a statistics major than a social sciences major (superset of statistics), but they do not think that he is more likely to be a Hebrew language major than a humanities major (superset of Hebrew language). Thus, only when the person seems highly representative of a category is that category judged as more probable than its superordinate category.

The same benefits and risks that apply to a large subgroup (e.g. neurotypical individuals without mental illness) may not apply to subpopulations who differ in meaningful ways from that majority (e.g. people who do not fit into that category), and this might lead people in that subpopulation to form unrealistic expectations, unrealistic plans, unrealistic risk:benefit evaluations, and unwarranted optimsim (or pessimism) regarding their ability to maintain the behavior once they have started it. By realising the ways in which they differ from the rest of the population, this might help the subpopulation to more realistically plan, think about, enact and maintain the behavior (perhaps using different strategies from the rest of the population). For example, regularly practicing mindfulness meditation has been shown in multiple studies to produce mental health benefits, but this does not imply that regular mindfulness meditation would benefit everyone (and there are some subpopulations with mental health concerns that might preclude them from some of the benefits, e.g. people with dissociative identity disorder or a history of trauma might in some cases be harmed rather than helped by some of the states induced by mindfulness meditation).

False Consensus Effect,"A person tends to overestimate how much other people agree with him or her.

Additionally, when confronted with evidence that a consensus does not exist, people often assume that those who do not agree with them are defective in some way.

This bias can be traced back to primarily two roots. According to social comparison, individuals evaluate their thoughts and attitudes based on other people, and often look towards others to find a ""norm"" by which they may judge themselves. The problem, though, is that people are often unable to accurately perceive the social norm and the actual attitudes of others.

Focusing Effect,"The Focusing Effect (or Focusing iIllusion) is a cognitive bias that occurs when people place too much importance on one aspect of an event (especially, the aspect they happen to be thinking about at the moment).

Similar to Actor-observer Bias, but in this case the focus is on a person's interpretation of others' actions, rather than of one's own actions.

Jones and Harris hypothesized that people would attribute apparently freely-chosen behaviors to disposition, and apparently chance-directed behaviors to situation. The hypothesis was confounded by the Fundamental Attribution Error. Subjects read pro- and anti-Fidel Castro essays, and were then asked to rate the pro-Castro attitudes of the writers.

Gambler's Fallacy,"The belief that if deviations from expected behavior are observed in repeated independent trials of some random process, future deviations in the opposite direction are then more likely.

After the first four tosses the results are no longer unknown, so their probabilities are 1.

For example, if someone reads news articles about nutrition-related research, they may come to the conclusion that the conclusions reached by studies are a random process and that soon after the nutritional benefits of specific food items are demonstrated in studies, there will also be a series of directly contradictory studies, where the same food is found to have negative health impacts. If they then assume that this will apply all the time, they might decide to try to get one step ahead and to base their diet on their arbitrary predictions about which studies are about to be contradicted next.

People overestimate the core association between variables such as stereotyped groups and stereotypic behavior.

Rupert Brown and Amanda Smith (1989) tested the hypothesis by conducting a study involving the academic staff at a British university.

Results were divided into four groups, depending on actual performance. It was found that all four groups evaluated their performance as above average, meaning that the lowest-scoring group (the bottom 25%) showed a very large Illusory Superiority Bias.

Information Bias,"Involves e.g., distorted evaluation of information. Information Bias occurs due to people's curiosity and confusion of goals when trying to choose a course of action. An example of Information Bias is believing that the more information that can be acquired to make a decision, the better, even if that extra information is irrelevant for the decision.

Ingroup Bias,"The tendency for people to give preferential treatment to others they perceive to be members of their own groups.

The need to improve self esteem may be one cause of this bias: individuals will find a reason, no matter how insignificant, to prove to themselves why their group is superior. By having a more positive impression of individuals in the in-group, individuals are able to boost their own self-esteem as members of that group.

Robert Cialdini and his research team looked at the number of university T-shirts being worn on college campuses following either a win or loss at the football game. Not surprisingly, the Monday after a win there were more T-shirts being worn, on average, than following a loss.

On the other hand, there are also cases where this fallacy may be counterproductive (such as when a behavior is seen s putting the person at risk of differing too much from what they perceive as the ingroup norm), a benevolent helper could point out that this is an undesirable bias that has multiple negative impacts (including in other areas of life), and could encourage the person to focus on the behavior itself, rather than the people or organization(s) they associate (or don't associate) with it.

Just-world Phenonmenon,"The tendency for people to want to believe that the world is fundamentally just. As a result, when they witness an otherwise inexplicable injustice, they rationalize it by searching for things that the victim might have done to deserve it, often at the expense of blaming victims for things that were not, objectively, their fault.

One cause of this phenomenon may be the need to protect one's own sense of invulnerability. They want to believe that if the potential victim avoids the behaviors of the past victims, then they themselves will remain safe.

In one study, female and male subjects were told two versions of a story about an interaction between a woman and a man.

Some studies suggest that losses are twice as powerful, psychologically, as gains. Whether a transaction is framed as a loss or a gain is very important: would you rather get a $5 discount (win), or avoid a $5 surcharge (loss)? The same change in price framed differently has a significant effect on consumer behavior. In other words, losses have a more profound effect on us than does a gain of the same value. Recent studies have questioned the existance of loss aversion. One found that loss aversion does not exist in small payoff magnitudes. Another found that loss aversion is more likely to affect a person in competitive situations.

The Ludic Fallacy could cause people to prematurely stop searching for information about how to complete the behavior (thus affecting the degree to which they meet the ""Knows"" condition), and/or could cause them to prematurely stop searching for ways to make their environment more conducive to their desired behavior(s), because they conclude that they know everything there is to know about the situation. They may believe, for example, that it is impossible to improve the environmental conditions (e.g. such that the environment would increase their success in starting and continuing the behavior). The same fallacy may also cause someone to assume that they should give up trying or maintaining the behavior for other reasons, and to be too sure about this conclusion (without acknolwedging key uncertainties). A longer-term solution to this tendency might be to encourage the person to practice probabilistic thinking, with particular attention being paid to estimating their level of uncertainty in every belief that they form. (For example, they could note that, although they can be sure that they are currently having thoughts [if they are thinking about this idea, then they must be thinking], this is probably the only thing they can really be sure about, and beyond that, that there is some degree of uncertainty in almost every statement).

  - Professional financial analysts consistently overestimated corporate earnings;

Maintains.","Optimism bias could be an important factor to keep in mind, both for the person changing their behavior, and anyone supporting them in doing so, at every stage of behavior change (from the planning through to implementation and maintenance of the behavior). It has been documented to be a persistent tendency in healthy adults (ref), and it has the potential to either be helpful or counterproductive to behavior change, depending on how unrealistic it is and depending on what the optimism pertains to. For example, the tendency to persist in the face of challenges (which could be seen as a form of behavioral optimism) appears to be predicted by a person's level of intellectual humility ([Porter et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1041608020300686?casa_token=sJNl4ThLbWUAAAAA:E8U8KRkr11qvyWjYzRoIIiR8SaC_J2L9rML1N-a1qBt0CgNVIEPjWli410B7hb0ONUG7HtQ8x-8)). If intellectual humility is a quality that can be nurtured or encouraged, then this might represent an attractive way to encourage people to persist in the face of challenges (behavioral optimism), without encouraging them to become overconfident. Optimism bias can also interact with the Observer-expectancy Effect and the placebo effect. As long as the person being encouraged is aware of the biased nature of this reasoning (and is therefore not being misled as to the intentions behind such encouragement), and as long as the person's expectations are not so high as to be unrealistic, having optimistic expectations in and of themselves could increase the probability that the person performs better than they would have (had their expectations been lower). For example, if you think that there is a 75% probability that three months from now, your friend will be engaging in moderate-intensity physical activity for between 20 and 150 minutes per week, and their goal is to do that for at least 120 minutes per week,  reminding them that they *can* do it would be both true and encouraging, and may help them to feel more optimistic about their chances of success (compared to e.g. reminding them that there's also a decent chance that they could fall well short of their goal). However, it is also worth keeping in mind that encouragement is only one factor that could influence the degree of optimism bias someone experiences; it may also be driven by their own personal characteristics and health conditions, including whether they have depression (which has been documented to decrease or even reverse this bias, to the detriment of the person's wellbeing [todo: ref]). There are also cases were optimism bias could be excessive, to the point of causing the person to form unrealistic ideas about their abilities or about the best ways of implementing and continuing the behavior; in such cases, a benevolent helper could help the person to adjust their beliefs, by clearly explaining the actual probability of success in engaging in behavior change in similar scenarios, and by helping people to think about the probabilities of negative outcomes, and plans for responding to them.

Ostrich Effect,"The Ostrich Effect is the tendency to avoid apparently risky (financial) situations by pretending they do not exist. The name comes from the common (but false) legend that ostriches bury their heads in the sand to avoid danger.

On the other hand, if the behavior change is perceived as being associated with an outgroup, then it may be perceived as a more standardized activity that a homogeneous group of people adopts without variation, potentially also with very specific conditions required before being perceived as meeting the ""Has"" condition). A benevolent helper could point out that outgroup biases are undesirable for multiple reasons, and could encourage the person to focus on the behavior itself, rather than the people or organization(s) they associate (or don't associate) with it.

Outcome Bias,"One will often judge a past decision by its ultimate outcome instead of by the quality of the decision at the time it was made, given what was known at that time. This is an error because no decision maker ever knows whether or not a calculated risk will turn out for the best. Individuals whose judgments are influenced by Outcome Bias are seemingly holding decision makers responsible for events beyond their control. The reason why an individual makes this mistake is that he or she will incorporate presently available information when evaluating a past decision. 

Baron and Hershey (1988) presented subjects with hypothetical situations in order to test this. One such example involved a surgeon deciding whether or not to do a risky surgery on a patient. The surgery had a known probability of success. Subjects were presented with either a good or bad outcome (in this case living or dying), and asked to rate the quality of the surgeon's pre-operation decision.

Overconfidence Effect,"Excessive confidence in one's own answers to questions. The Overconfidence Effect is one of the most important and well-studied cognitive biases in psychology and behavioral economics. Overconfidence has been studied in three different ways:

  1. Overestimation of one's performance, ability, level of control, or rate of work; 
  2. An inflated belief that one is better than others, or overplacement; and
  3. An excessive belief in the truth and accuracy of one’s beliefs, or overprecision.

One is example is shown in a spelling task, where subjects were correct about 80% of the time when they were ""100% certain."" Put another way, the error rate was 20% when subjects expected it to be 0%.

In cases where this fallacy is counterproductive, a benevolent helper could point out this effect and/or point out examples of ways in which it might apply. For example, if someone was assuming that they already know enough information to be able to perform a complex new behavior, it might help to point out to them that people with less knowledge of an area are less equipped to assess their own skill level in that area and less equipped to understand the relative difficulty of that behavior (which can also contribute to the Planning Fallacy). If the person is equipped with this knowleddge and takes it into consideration, this may enable them to set more realistic expectations and goals, which might increase the chance that they remain motivated to continue improving their skills over time and to maintain the behavior over time. If the person is excessively confident in the accuracy of their beliefs, a longer-term solution might be to encourage them to practice probabilisitc thinking and epistemic/intellectual humility (i.e. encourage them to realise that nothing is certain and that their beliefs could always turn out to be inaccurate).",
"Overvaluing Short-term Benefits compared to Long-term Benefits, or Temporal Discounting (see Hyperbolic Discounting)","This is similar to Hyperbolic Discounting in that subjects prefer benefits or rewards sooner rather than later, which may lead to Dynamic Inconsistency: how each different self of a decision-maker may have different preferences over current and future choices. For example, a decision maker holds the view that ""now"" has especially high value compared to any future time. This Temporal Discounting is a tendency to give greater value to rewards as they move away from their temporal horizons and towards the ""now"".

Carl Sagan hypothesized that as a survival technique, human beings are ""hard-wired"" from birth to identify the human face. This allows people to use only minimal details to recognize faces from a distance and in poor visibility, but can also lead them to interpret random images or patterns of light and shade as being faces. The evolutionary advantages of being able to identify friend from foe with split-second accuracy are numerous. For example, prehistoric (and even modern) men and women who accidentally identify an enemy as a friend could face deadly consequences for this mistake.

Reactance,"An emotional reaction in direct contradiction to rules or regulations that threaten or eliminate specific behavioral freedoms. Reactance can cause a person to adopt or strengthen a view or attitude that is contrary to what was intended, and also increases resistance to persuasion.

There are four important elements to reactance theory: perceived freedom, threat to freedom, reactance, and restoration of freedom. Freedom is not an abstract consideration, but rather a feeling associated with real behaviors, including actions, emotions, and attitudes. 

One study concluded that one way to increase the activity of a threatened freedom is to censor it, or provide a threatening message toward the activity. In turn a ""boomerang effect"" occurs, in which people choose forbidden alternatives. This study also shows that social influence has better results when it does not threaten one's core freedoms.

People are motivated to protect their self-esteem; they may be attempting to protect their reputation by advertising successes and shifting blame for failures publicly, regardless of their true understanding of the situation. Additionally, success may be more readily available to memory than failure.",cognitive bias,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-serving_bias,,,,,,,,,,,,
Semmelweis Reflex,"The tendency to reject new evidence that contradicts an established paradigm. There is some uncertainty regarding the origin and generally accepted use of the expression. It refers to Ignaz Semmelweis, who discovered that childbed fever mortality rates could be reduced ten-fold if doctors would wash their hands (we would now say disinfect) with a chlorine solution between having contact with infected patients and non-infected patients. His hand-washing suggestions were rejected by his contemporaries.",cognitive bias,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semmelweis_reflex,,,,"You've been taking the same route to work every day for over a year, and you're pretty positive that it's the most efficient route available.

Status Quo Bias,"A cognitive bias for the status quo; in other words, people tend not to change an established behavior unless the incentive to change is compelling. The US states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania inadvertently ran a real life experiment providing evidence of the Status Quo Bias in the early 1990s. As part of Tort law reform programs, citizens were offered two options for their automotive insurance: an expensive option giving them full right to sue, and a less expensive option with restricted rights to sue. In New Jersey the cheaper option was the default and most citizens selected it, while only a minority chose it in Pennsylvania where the more expensive option was the default. Similar effects have been shown for contributions to retirement plans, choice of internet privacy policies and the decision to become an organ donor.",cognitive bias,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo_bias,,,,"You've been using a social networking site for years.

Stereotyping,"Expecting a member of a group to have certain characteristics without having actual information about that individual.

The term ""stereotype"" derives from the Greek words στερεός (stereos), meaning ""firm, solid"", and τύπος (typos), meaning ""impression,"" hence: ""solid impression"". It was originally a term used in the world of printing to describe a duplicate impression of an original typographical element, used for printing instead of the original.

There are many theories about why individuals tend to stereotype. One theory is that stereotyping is the most convenient way to sort information - grouping large numbers of people and experiences together. It could also be the case that one's childhood experiences are primary in the creation of stereotypes, and these stereotypes learned in childhood are self-perpetuating, growing stronger as an individual ages. A third theory focuses on an individual's need to feel good about him or herself. If I am part of Group A, and Group A is ""right"" about everything, then it is best for my self esteem to lump other individuals into separate, inferior groups.",cognitive bias,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotyping,,,,,,,,,,,,
Straw Man Fallacy,"Attempting to win an argument by refuting an easier to handle version of the opponent's position that they don't actually believe.

Subadditivity,"The tendency to judge the probability of the whole to be less than the sum of the probabilities of the component parts.

For instance, subjects in one experiment judged that the probability of death from cancer in the United States was 18%, the probability from heart attack was 22%, and the probability of death from ""other natural causes"" was 33%. Other participants judged that the probability of death from a natural cause was 58%. Natural causes are made up precisely of cancer, heart attack, and ""other natural causes,"" however, the sum of the latter three probabilities was 73%, and not 58%. According to Tversky and Koehler (1994) this kind of result is observed consistently.",cognitive bias,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subadditivity_effect,,,,,,"Ask about the probability of something happening (e.g. dying in next twenty years) in one part of test, then ask about the probability of specific instances of that thing happening later in the test (e.g. dying of cancer, dying in a car accident, etc. in the next twenty years) and see if they add up to more than the initial probability.

Subjective Validation,"The perception that something is true if a subject's belief demands it to be true. Also assigns perceived connections between coincidences.

System Justification,"A scientific theory within social psychology that proposes that people have a motivation to defend and bolster the status quo, i.e., to see it as good, legitimate, and desirable.

Early SJT (Situational Judgement Tests) research focused on compensatory stereotypes. Experiments suggested that the widespread endorsement of stereotypes such as ""poor but happy"" or ""rich but miserable"" exist to balance out the gap between those of low and high socioeconomic status. Later work suggested that these compensatory stereotypes are preferred by leftists while rightists prefer non-complimentary stereotypes such as ""poor and dishonest"" or ""rich and honest"", which rationalize inequality rather than compensate for it.

This differs from the Status Quo Bias because it is predominately motivational, rather than cognitive. It is considered to be motivational because its effects are exacerbated when people are under psychological threat, or when they feel their outcomes are especially dependent on the system that is being justified.",cognitive bias,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_justification,,,,,,,,,,"1. Considers, 2. Desires, 3. Intends","To overcome this bias, ask people to consider whether or not they'd press an imaginary ""reset"" button if given the opportunity. For example, if the status quo involves social stigmas or even violence against a minority group, ask people whether they'd be willing to press an imaginary ""reset"" button that completely erases all current prejudices (even if these prejudices might re-develop over time).

Defense of the status quo can also occur when people haven't imagined the alternatives vividly enough. For example, calls to ""defund the police"" often cause people to imagine a society in chaos and collapse, and thus to continue funding the police; so opponents of police funding may have to work extra hard to help the public to imagine what a society could look like if less money was spent on policing and more money was spent on education, social services, and healthcare.",
Telescoping Effect in Memory,"People's tendency to perceive recent events as being more remote than they are, and to perceive distant events as being more recent than they are. More specifically, the former is known as ""backward telescoping"", and the latter as ""forward telescoping"". Between backward and forward telescoping there lies a point at which events are just as likely to be displaced backward as forward in time.

The original work is usually attributed to a 1964 article by Neter and Waksberg in the Journal of the American Statistical Association.","memory bias, recency, past",http://www2.fiu.edu/~dwright/pdf/telescopepoq.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Accuracy of our Memories of our Emotional Responses,"Oddly, we don't seem to learn all that much from our own experience. To learn from experience requires that we be able to remember it, and research shows that people are about as bad at remembering their past emotions as they are predicting their future emotions. That's why we make the same errors again and again. For example, in one of our studies, Democrats predicted they'd be devastated if Bush won the 2004 presidential election, and as we always find, they were not nearly as devastated as they predicted. But several months after the election, they remembered being just as devastated as they had expected to be. It turns out that this is a very common pattern of memory errors. Retrospection and prospection share many of the same biases, and hence reinforce each other.","happiness, emotion, memory, memory bias",http://www.randomhouse.com/kvpa/gilbert/qa.html,,,,,,,,,,"2.

The Fallacy of Difference,"The tendency to attribute the outcome of a situation to whatever traits make that situation most unusual.

For instance, if your friend and his wife get a divorce, you might assume that it was due to the fact that they were in an open marriage (a trait that made their marriage stand out as unusual), rather than taking into account the fact that it is common for relationships of all types to end.",cognitive bias,http://rationallyspeaking.blogspot.com/2011/07/fallacy-of-difference-in-science-and.html,,,,,,,,,,3.

Thinking in Categories / Binary Thinking,"Lumping things into simple categories, like ""good and bad"", ""right and wrong"", ""easy and hard"" rather than viewing things as being on a continuum.",cognitive bias,http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/groups/finance/cat3.pdf,,,,,,,,,,"2. Desires, 5. Believes","Ask people to compare extremes within one of their categories as a way of showing that the category is too simple.

Similarly, for all of the items in all of the categories, sort them along each spectrum from lowest to highest.

Also, point out to people that simple categories often represent a conflation or compression of multiple spectra. For example, ""good and bad"" actually includes spectra like intentions (an action can be performed with more or less benevolent motivations), consequences (an action can have more or less beneficial outcomes), context (an action is more or less socially acceptable in certain circumstances), etc.",

Typical Mind Fallacy,"The typical mind fallacy is the mistake of modeling the minds inside other people's brains as exactly the same as your own mind.

There was a debate, in the late 1800s, about whether ""imagination"" was simply a turn of phrase or a real phenomenon. That is, can people actually create images in their minds which they see vividly, or do they simply say ""I saw it in my mind"" as a metaphor for considering what it looked like?

The debate was resolved by Francis Galton, who among other achievements invented eugenics, the ""wisdom of crowds"", and standard deviation. Galton gave people some very detailed surveys, and found that some people did have mental imagery and others did not. The ones who did simply assumed everyone did, and the ones who didn't simply assumed everyone didn't, to the point of coming up with absurd justifications for why they were lying or misunderstanding the question. There was a wide spectrum of imaging ability, from about five percent of people with perfect eidetic imagery to three percent of people completely unable to form mental images.","fallacy, logical fallacy",http://lesswrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ultimate Attribution Error,"This is a bias that people commonly have toward members of an out-group. Similar to the Fundamental Attribution Error, in this error a person is likely to make an internal attribution to an entire group instead of the individuals within the group. For example, they may view negative acts committed by out-group members as a stable trait of the out-group, and positive acts committed by out-group members as exceptions to normal behavior. It is considered to be one of the roots of prejudice.

In his 1976 demonstration, Birt Duncan asked White participants to watch a video of a man shoving another man. One video had a Caucasian male shoving another Caucasian male and a second video had an African American male shoving a Caucasian male. When the participants watched the first video they concluded that the Caucasian male doing the shoving was attributed to having fun (a situational factor), but when they watched the second video they attributed the African American’s behavior to an aggressive personality (Duncan, 1979). The results of Duncan's study demonstrates that ultimate attribution error is more likely to occur when there are negative associations with members of an out-group due to previous conflict or certain situations that were experienced (Whitley & Kite, 2010).",cognitive bias,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_attribution_error,,,,,,,,,,"2.

Zeigarnik Effect in Memory,"States that people remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks.

Soviet psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik first studied the phenomenon after her professor, Gestalt psychologist Kurt Lewin, noticed that a waiter had better recollections of still unpaid orders.

In Gestalt psychology, the Zeigarnik effect has been used to demonstrate the general presence of Gestalt phenomena: not just appearing as perceptual effects, but also present in cognition.

The Zeigarnik effect suggests that students who ""suspend"" their study, during which they do unrelated activities (such as studying unrelated subjects or playing games), will remember material better than students who complete study sessions without a break (Zeigarnik, 1927; McKinney 1935).","memory bias, memorizing, completion",http://www.psychwiki.com/wiki/Zeigarnik_Effect,,,,,,,,,,7.
