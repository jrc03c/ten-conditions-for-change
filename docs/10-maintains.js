	description: "We're very unlikely to perform future required actions if, due to the experience of taking earlier actions or due to the passage of time, the conditions mentioned above (Desires, Intends, Remembers, Believes, etc.) fall below adequate levels. For example, after taking the first action in a sequence of actions that compose a new behavior, a person may become discouraged if the action doesn't go well. So, even if the Believes condition was previously met for that action, it may no longer be met after the person has attempted the action once. Or a person may initially meet the Desires condition for a new behavior but might cease to meet that condition as time passes if they forget why they cared about adopting the behavior in the first place.",

	question: "How can you help the target person or population maintain sufficiently high levels of the other nine conditions for change listed above as time passes and as they complete each of the various required actions?",
