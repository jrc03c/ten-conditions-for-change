	description: `
		We're very unlikely to perform a specific action unless we have the physical capacities, mental capabilities, and skills needed to perform that action. For instance, even if someone knows how to use a weight machine (as a part of their fitness plan), they may be physically incapable of using the machine if they have a shoulder injury.

		We may fail to embody all the traits needed to carry out an action for various reasons:

		<ol type="A">
			<li><b>Physical Characteristics</b>—e.g., we may not have sufficient strength or balance to carry out an action</li>
			<li><b>Injuries</b>—e.g., we may have a hand injury that prevents us from carrying out the action safely</li>
			<li><b>Physical Disabilities or Handicaps</b>—e.g., if we are blind, we are not going to be able to carry out actions that require sight</li>
			<li><b>Mental Characteristics</b>—e.g., if we have severe dyslexia, we may find it difficult to carry out actions that involve reading complex material</li>
			<li><b>Skills</b>—e.g., if an action involves a difficult series of steps, we may require training to build the skills necessary to carry out the action</li>
		</ol>
