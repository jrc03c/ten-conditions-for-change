	title: "Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy (2013)",

	year: 2013,

	content: `
		The [Behavior Change Technique (BCT) Taxonomy](http://openaccess.city.ac.uk/3293/1/Michie%20et%20al%20Annals%20of%20Behavioral%20Medicine%202013%20-%20BCT%20Taxonomy%20v1.pdf), created by Susan Michie, Michelle Richardson, Marie Johnston et al., provides a hierarchical clustering of 93 behavior change techniques (based on expert ratings of behavior change techniques from six previously published classification systems). It divides these techniques into 16 top level categories:

		1. *Goals and planning* (e.g., goal-setting, problem-solving, action planning, and reviewing behavior goals)
		2. *Feedback and monitoring* (e.g., monitoring by others, feedback on behavior, self-monitoring, and biofeedback)
		3. *Social support* (e.g., practical or emotional social support)
		4. *Shaping knowledge* (e.g., instruction, information about antecedents, re-attribution, and behavioral experiments)
		5. *Natural consequences* (e.g., information about health consequences, consequence salience, information about social consequences, and monitoring of emotional consequences)
		6. *Comparison of behavior* (e.g., demonstrations, social comparison, and information about others' approval)
		7. *Associations* (e.g., prompts/cues, cues signalling rewards, removing access to rewards, and removing aversive stimuli)
		8. *Repetition and substitution* (e.g., behavioral practice, behavioral substitution, habit formation, and graded tasks)
		9. *Comparison of outcomes* (e.g., credible sources, pros and cons, and comparative imagining of future outcomes)
		10. *Reward and threat* (e.g., material incentives, material rewards, social rewards, and future punishment)
		11. *Regulation* (e.g., pharmacological support, reducing negative emotions, conserving mental resources, and paradoxical instructions)
		12. *Antecedents* (e.g., restructuring the physical environment, restructuring the social environment, reducing exposure to behavioral cues, and distraction)
		13. *Identity* (e.g, identification of self as role model, reframing, incompatible beliefs, and identity associated with changed behavior)
		14. *Scheduled consequences* (e.g., behavior cost, punishment, removing reward, and reducing reward frequency)
		15. *Self-belief* (e.g., verbal persuasion about capability, mental rehearsal of successful performance, focus on past success, and self-talk)
		16. *Covert learning* (e.g., imaginary punishment, imaginary reward, and vicarious consequences)

		**Connection**: The BCT Taxonomy can be useful for finding interventions to apply across any of the conditions in our framework.
