	title: "Theoretical Domains Framework (2005)",

	year: 2005,

	content: `
		The [Theoretical Domains Framework](https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1748-5908-7-37) (TDF) was initially developed by Susan Michie, Marie Johnston, Charles Abraham, and other members of the "Psychological Theory" Group in consultation with a group of 13 health service researchers and 30 health psychologists. It was first [published in 2005](https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/14/1/26.full) but [updated in 2012](https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1748-5908-7-37). The initial aim of the framework "was to create an accessible and memorable summary of behavior change theory." During its development, the scope of the TDF was limited to those domains which were determined to be "particularly relevant to (a) understanding and changing behavior in interdisciplinary research and (b) intervening to change the behavior of healthcare professionals." Despite the initial focus on health professionals' behavior, the TDF has subsequently been applied to other behavior change situations, including interventions pertaining to population health, occupational health, transportation, and the environment.

		The TDF consists of the following domains, each of which has a set of associated constructs listed beside them:

		- **Knowledge**, which includes knowledge about condition / scientific rationale, schemas + mindsets + illness representations, procedural knowledge, and other knowledge 
		- **Skills**, which includes skills themselves, competence / ability / skill assessment, practice / skills development, interpersonal skills, and coping strategies
		- **Social / professional role and identity**, which includes identity, professional identity / boundaries / role, group / social identity, social / group norms, and alienation / organizational commitment
		- **Beliefs about capabilities**, including self-efficacy, control of behavior and of resources, social environment, perceived competence, self-confidence / professional confidence, empowerment, self-esteem, perceived behavioral control, and optimism / pessimism
		- **Beliefs about consequences**, including outcome expectancies, anticipated regret, appraisal / evaluation / review, consequents, attitudes, contingencies, reinforcement / punishment / consequences, incentives / rewards, beliefs, unrealistic optimism, salient events / sensitisation / critical incidents, and characteristics of outcome expectancies (physical, social, and emotional, as well as whether outcomes are perceived as sanctions vs. rewards, proximal vs. distal, valued vs. not valued, probable vs. improbable, salient vs. not salient, and high vs. low-risk)
		- **Motivation and goals**, including the certainty and stability of a person's intention(s), goals themselves, goal target(s) / setting(s), goal priority, intrinsic motivation, commitment, distal and proximal goals, and the transtheoretical model and relevant stages of change
		- **Memory, attention, and decision processes**, which includes memory, attention, attention control, and decision-making
		- **Environmental context and resources**, including availability and management of material resources, environmental stressors, person-environment interactions, and knowledge of task environment
		- **Social influences**, which includes social support, social / group norms, organizational development, leadership, teamwork, group conformity, organizational climate / culture, social pressure, power / hierarchy, professional boundaries / roles, management commitment, supervision, inter-group conflict, champions, social comparisons, identity (group / social identity), organizational commitment / alienation, feedback, conflict (competing demands and conflicting roles), change management, crew resource management, negotiation, social support (personal / professional / organizational, intra / interpersonal, society / community), social / group norms (subjective, descriptive, injunctive norms), and learning and modelling
		- **Emotion**, including affect, stress, anticipated regret, fear, burn-out, cognitive overload / tiredness, threat, positive / negative affect, and anxiety / depression
		- **Behavioral regulation**, including goal / target setting, implementation intentions, action planning, self-monitoring, goal priority, generating alternatives, feedback, moderators of intention-behavior gaps, project management, and barriers and facilitators
		- **Optimism**, which includes optimism, pessimism, unrealistic optimism, and identity
		- **Intentions**, which includes the stability of intentions, the transtheoretical model, and stages of change
		- **Reinforcement**, which includes rewards (proximal / distal, valued / not valued, probable / improbable), incentives, punishment, consequents, reinforcement, contingencies, and sanctions

		To help researchers to make optimal use of TDF in implementing behavior change, [a guide to using the TDF in practice](https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13012-017-0605-9) was published in 2017. The authors recommended that TDF-based implementation research should include the following steps:

		1. **Select and specify the target behavior(s):** "Use documentary analysis or empirical research to identify and specify who should do what differently, to increase the uptake of evidence-based practice."
		2. **Select the study design:** "[The designs may] involve semi-structured individual interviews, focus group interviews, questionnaires, structured observations, documentary analysis, or consensus processes."
		3. **Develop study materials:** "Although materials from previous studies may be used as templates, materials should be adapted to be appropriate to the specified behavior(s) and context."
		4. **Decide the sampling strategy:** "For exploratory studies, a maximum variation approach is appropriate."
		5. **Collect the data:** "Published studies have used audio-recorded interviews (face-to-face or telephone; one-to-one or focus group) or questionnaires (paper-based or online)."
		6. **Analyse the data:** "The objective is to identify the domains that are most relevant to the implementation problem being addressed and to populate those domains with context-relevant and behaviorally specific content."
		7. **Report findings:** "For interview studies, report presents tables that include illustrative quotations, specific beliefs identified (with frequencies, if appropriate), and classification into domains."

		**Connection:** The domains of the TDF can be mapped onto our Ten Conditions for Change framework. The knowledge domain is especially relevant to the Considers condition in our DECISION phase and the Knows condition of our ACTION phase, and the skills domain is relevant to the Embodies condition of our ACTION phase. Beliefs about capabilities, beliefs about consequences, optimism, intentions, and goals are all relevant to the three conditions of our DECISION phase, as well as to the Believes, Chooses, and Embodies conditions of our ACTION phase. The domain of "memory, attention, and decision processes" is relevant to our DECISION phase, and to the Remembers, Chooses, and Embodies conditions of our ACTION phase. Moreover, all of our conditions for change can benefit from considering factors pertaining to the other TDF domains of behavioral regulation, social influences, social / professional role and identity, environmental context and resources, reinforcement, and emotion. Finally, all of the TDF domains could also be usefully applied when considering how to meet the Maintains condition during our CONTINUATION phase.
