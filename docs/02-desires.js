	description: `
		Even if we've considered adopting a new behavior, we're very unlikely to actually do so unless we desire to adopt it. There are two different types of desire:

		<ol type="A">
			<li><b>Intuitive Desire</b>—a gut level positive feeling or emotion about engaging in a behavior (e.g., "I have a good feeling about doing this behavior")</li>
			<li><b>Reflective Desire</b>—an analytical, reasoned belief that the behavior is worthwhile (e.g., "I've carefully considered the pros and cons and concluded that the benefits of the behavior outweigh the costs").</li>
		</ol>

		To make a behavior likely, it's critical to have at least one of these two forms of desires, but it's best if the person desires the behavior in both the intuitive and reflective senses.
