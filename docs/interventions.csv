,DISCOUNTING,"The further out into the future that benefits or costs will be accrued or incurred, the less people care about them. So benefits in one minute are valued more than benefits tomorrow, which are valued more than benefits in one year. One type of discounting is hyperbolic discounting, according to which how much people care about future benefits ""fall relatively rapidly for earlier delay periods (as in, from now to one week), but then fall more slowly for longer delay periods (for instance, more than a few days). For example, in a study subjects said they would be indifferent between receiving $15 immediately or $30 after 3 months, $60 after 1 year, or $100 after 3 years. These indifferences reflect annual discount rates that declined from 277% to 139% to 63% as delays got longer. This contrasts with exponential discounting, in which valuation falls by a constant factor per unit delay and the discount rate stays the same."" Another effect of hyperbolic discounting is that ""many people prefer $100 now to $110 in a day, but very few people prefer $100 in 30 days to $110 in 31 days."" In other words: ""More generally, the rate at which people discount future rewards declines as the length of the delay increases"". When the intrinsic benefit of the behavior change is delayed in time (for example, if a person is trying to lose weight the goal will take at least months to be met), people are more likely to choose to not perform the desired action for the immediate pleasure / reward (eating a bowl of ice cream) because of excessively high rates of discounting, so interventions to address this have to make the delayed reward more desirable or build in immediate rewards (e.g., marking one more day of eating healthy on a tracker).",6.

Possible forms of Consciousness-Raising:

Developing new interpretations of your thoughts, feelings or behavior with a therapist's help

Revelations about the consequences of your behaviors or beliefs (e.g. realizing that you take your problems out on people, and that this behavior undermines your personal relationships)

,Social Liberation,"In many cases, the circumstances of daily life — the types of environment you operate in and the behaviors considered acceptable in those environments — can help or hinder efforts to change your behavior. Consider, for example, how difficult it would be to quit smoking if you spent all of your time in places where many people around you were smoking regularly. The Social Liberation strategy aims to facilitate positive behavior change by changing the social environment to make such changes easier, typically by altering the legal / regulatory frameworks that govern public behavior. In the case of smoking in the United States, Social Liberation has taken the form of indoor smoking bans and restrictions on where people can smoke outside.



Possible forms of Social Liberation:

Top-down public health policy interventions (e.g. smoking ban laws)

Efforts to change social mores (e.g. increasing the social acceptance of trans people)

Specifically choosing environments that support a behavior change (e.g. avoiding bars)

Relocating to a region with more compatible values (e.g. moving to a city where homosexuality is more accepted)",,,,,A group of strategies already in the database,,,,,"https://www.clearerthinking.org/single-post/2017/06/07/9-strategies-therapists-use-to-change-behaviors - based on book ""Changing For Good""",,,,,,407

,Self-Reevaluation,"Sometimes the key to changing your behavior is to consider what kind of person your current behavior makes you, what kind of person you'd like to be, and how adopting new behaviors might help you achieve that goal. This process of frank emotional reflection on your current state and how it differs from your preferences is the crux of the Self-Reevaluation strategy. As Changing For Good puts it, this process often entails asking yourself a series of difficult questions: ""How do you perceive yourself as a gambler, a drinker, or a sedentary person? How do you see yourself if you change your behavior? What will be the cost of that change, in time, energy, pleasure, stress, or image? What, overall, are the pros and cons of trying to overcome your problem?""



Possible forms of Self-Reevaluation:

Value clarification (e.g. putting your priorities in a new order)

Future visualization (e.g. ""what will I be like after I make this change?"")

Pros vs. cons analysis",,,5. To be deleted,,This strategy is a combination of others that are already on the list,,,,,"https://www.clearerthinking.org/single-post/2017/06/07/9-strategies-therapists-use-to-change-behaviors - based on book ""Changing For Good""",,,,,,409
,Commitment,"Ultimately, only you can change your own behavior. This fact can make behavior change attempts seem daunting, but it also creates an opening that can actually help you push yourself to reshape your ways. The Commitment strategy involves announcing your intentions to the public or to members of your social circle. By doing so, you commit your social credibility to achieving your goal — thereby creating a powerful incentive to follow through and avoid the shame of public failure. New Year's Resolutions are a common Commitment strategy example.



Possible forms of Commitment:

Resolutions

Publicly tracking behavior change performance (e.g. social fitness apps)

Frequently discussing behavior change efforts with friends / colleagues",,,5. To be deleted,,A group of strategies already in the database,,,,,"https://www.clearerthinking.org/single-post/2017/06/07/9-strategies-therapists-use-to-change-behaviors - based on book ""Changing For Good""",,,,,,410
,Countering,"The Countering strategy works on a very simple premise: when the urge to engage in an unhealthy behavior strikes, sub in a healthier behavior instead. Countering strategies are popular among dieters — think of tactically opting for a healthy fruit snack when a potato chip craving strikes. Another famous example: smokers often try to aid their efforts to quit by popping a mint or a piece of gum whenever they find themselves longing for a cigarette.



Possible forms of Countering:

Relaxation tactics

Systematic desensitization

,Environment Control,"The Environment Control strategy is similar to the Social Liberation strategy in that it involves altering your environment to make behavior change easier. In this case, though, the strategy focuses on changing the environments that you yourself directly control, such as your home or your workspace. The most common and obvious type of Environment Control tactic is removing unhealthy temptations — such as junk food, tobacco, alcohol, and so forth — from your home. But Environment Control tactics can take more positive forms too, such as a reminder placed in your workspace to go straight to the gym after work instead of going home.



Possible forms of Environment Control:

Avoiding high-risk environments

Removing risks from your own environment

Making your environment more conducive to new behavior

Equipping your environment with supplies for a new behavior",,,5. To be deleted,,Same as #8,,,,,"https://www.clearerthinking.org/single-post/2017/06/07/9-strategies-therapists-use-to-change-behaviors - based on book ""Changing For Good""",,,,,,412
,Rewards,"This strategy is one of the most simple and intuitive of the bunch, as well as one of the most effective. Rewarding good behavior is a time-tested method for supporting efforts to change habits. Commonplace examples abound, such as rewarding oneself with a dessert after hitting a dieting goal, or enticing yourself to exercise by limiting your TV-watching time to when you're on an exercise bike.



Possible forms of Rewards:

Reward for achieving a milestone

Reward for beginning individual instances of behavior practices

Self-praise for adherence to a new behavior",,,5. To be deleted,,It is a bundle of the rewards strategies already present in the file,,,,,"https://www.clearerthinking.org/single-post/2017/06/07/9-strategies-therapists-use-to-change-behaviors - based on book ""Changing For Good""",,,,,,413
, Helping Relationships,"As mentioned, the success or failure of any behavior change effort you undertake will ultimately fall to you. But while you can't control the behavior of your friends and family members, they can be an invaluable source of assistance. If let your close confidants in on your efforts, you'll do more than up the ante by putting your credibility into play a la the Commitment strategy. You'll also be able to ask them for logistical help (e.g. buying groceries that match a new diet) or moral support, in the form of encouragement or compassion.



If you're looking to change your own behavior, consider trying out combinations of these 9 strategies and seeing which ones work best for you. Or, better yet, contact a licensed practitioner (such as a cognitive-behavioral therapist) to help you sift through these strategies and come up with the combination best suited to helping you change your ways.",,,5.
