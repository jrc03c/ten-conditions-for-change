		The [Three B's Approach](https://irrationallabs.org/content/uploads/2018/02/Irrational-Labs-The-%E2%80%9C3Bs%E2%80%9D-Approach.pdf) is a framework created by [Irrational Labs](https://irrationallabs.org/) that can help in the design of behavior change interventions. It has been used by a number of companies in the design of their products. It focuses on:

		1. Identifying key **behaviors**, which are specific and measurable actions you want the user to take. Ask "Is this the single most important behavior for them to do?" and "How often do you want the user to do this behavior?"
		2. Reducing **barriers**, as they keep the users from doing the key behaviors. In this framework, "[every] click, every field, every signature, every step, every call, adds friction...Having to think and/or make a decision is also a barrier." But also: "There are times where we want to have barriers. Adding friction can keep people from doing undesirable behaviors."
		3. Amplifying **benefits** and creating new ones, which add motivation to perform the key behaviors. Ask "What would impact a user's life right now?" and "Does the benefit appeal to emotion?" The framework also suggests that to "amplify existing benefits we can use our behavioral tools like social proof and loss aversion," and that to "create new benefits we want to think about the product's longer term benefits that we can make more immediately salient."

		**Connection**: The key _behaviors_ in this model may correspond with the different ACTIONs that comprise a single complex behavior in the Ten Conditions for Change framework. In our framework, evaluating the conditions for success in the DECISION, ACTION, and CONTINUATION phases is related to considering (from the Three B's Approach perspective) how to reduce the _barriers_ and amplify _benefits_ of the behavior. _Barriers_ take many different forms, like additional steps when logging into a site, instructions that are difficult to understand or unappealing, distractions, and lack of knowledge. Strategies that aim to reduce _barriers_ standing in the way of behavior adoption can help meet the Remembers, Chooses, Knows, and Has conditions. Strategies that aim to increase the _benefits_ of behavior adoption - from immediate rewards to behavioral tools like social proof and loss aversion - can help meet the Desires, Believes, and Maintains conditions.
