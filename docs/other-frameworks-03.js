	title: "Transtheoretical Model (1977)",

	year: 1977,

	content: `
		The [Transtheoretical Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transtheoretical_model) (TTM) of behavior change, originally developed by [James O. Prochaska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_O._Prochaska) and Carlo Di Clemente, evaluates a person's readiness to engage in a new healthier behavior, and gives strategies to guide the change process. In this model, change progresses through six stages:

		1. *Precontemplation* ("not ready") - no action to improve the problem behavior is intended, and the undesirable behavior may not be recognized as being problematic
		2. *Contemplation* ("getting ready") - beginning to recognize the problematic behavior as being problematic, and considering pros and cons
		3. *Preparation* ("ready") - planning to take corrective action, and may be just beginning to take corrective action
		4. *Action* ("doing") - making concrete changes to their problem behaviors and adopting healthier behaviors
		5. *Maintenance* ("sustaining") - having sustained action for 6 or more months and working to avoid relapse
		6. *Termination* ("no temptation") - having certainty they will not return to the problematic behavior

		The TTM also says that, for people to progress through the six stages, they need these three factors:

		- *Decisional balance*, which is a growing awareness that the advantages of changing a behavior outweigh the disadvantages (i.e., the balance of "pros" vs. "cons")
		- *Self-efficacy*, which is confidence that they can make and maintain changes in situations that tempt them to return to their old, unhealthy behavior
		- *Processes of change*, which are strategies that can help them make and maintain change

		**Connection**: The Transtheoretical Model (TTM) relates to the Ten Conditions for Change model in the sense that our DECISION phase relates to the TTM Contemplation and Preparation stages, our ACTION phase relates to the TTM Action stage, and our CONTINUATION phase relates to the TTM Maintenance stage.
