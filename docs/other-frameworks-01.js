	title: "Theory of Planned Behavior (1985)",

	year: 1985,

	content: `
		The [Theory of Planned Behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_planned_behavior) (TPB), developed by Icek Ajzen, is an extension to the earlier [Theory of Reasoned Action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_reasoned_action) by Azjen and Martin Fishbein. It suggests that three factors lead to the intention to engage in a behavior (and ultimately to the behavior itself), namely:

		1. *Attitude* - e.g., a positive feeling about engaging in the behavior
		2. *Subjective Norm* - e.g., how the person thinks relevant community members, friends, or family members feel about them engaging in the behavior
		3.	*Perceived Behavior Control* - e.g., the extent to which the person thinks that they can control the given behavior, which also relates to a sense of self-efficacy

		**Connection**: The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) relates to the Ten Conditions of Change framework in that Attitude and Subjective Norm factors in TPB both connect to our Desires and Chooses conditions, and Perceived Behavior Control factor in TPB connects to our Believes condition.
