		The [Intervention Mapping](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1030.4260&rep=rep1&type=pdf) (IM) approach, by L. Kay Bartholomew, Guy S. Parcel, and Gerjo Kok, provides (1) a process for developing theory- and evidence-based health education programs and (2) a [taxonomy of behavior change methods](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17437199.2015.1077155). Intervention Mapping proceeds in [five steps](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1030.4260&rep=rep1&type=pdf):

		1. *Proximal Program Objectives* - "[This step] provides the foundation for the steps that follow by specifying proximal program objectives. These objectives explicate who and what will change as a result of the intervention...The products of step 1 are matrices containing cells created by the intersection of behavioral or environmental performance objectives with the theoretically and empirically based, important and changeable determinants of a behavior or environmental conditions. Each cell contains a statement, called a change objective, which specifies what individuals need to learn or what must be changed in the organizational or community environment as a result of the program."
		2. *Theoretical Methods and Practical Strategies* - "The goal of [this step] is to generate a list of intervention methods that are matched to the proximal program objectives stated in the matrices from step 1 and to think of practical and appropriate ways of delivering those methods to the target groups."
		3. *Design Program* - "The product of [this step] is a plan for the production and delivery of an organized program...In [this step], the planner uses qualitative methods such as focus groups to assure that the proposed strategies and program components are salient and acceptable to both implementers and participants. Movement back and forth between this task and step 4 is required."
		4. *Adoption and Implementation* - "For each stage, the planner must identify a target group for which adoption, implementation, and maintenance outcomes can be stated and determinants selected. The product of this step is a detailed plan of what needs to be done to ensure delivery of the program at acceptable levels of completeness and fidelity."
		5. *Monitoring and Evaluation* - "The product of this step is a plan for evaluating the impact of the intervention on determinants, behavior, and environmental conditions, and on health and quality of life outcomes"

		**Connection**: The Ten Conditions of Change model is most relevant to Step 2 (Theoretical Methods and Practical Strategies) of the Behavior Mapping approach, where it can be used to help select relevant behavior change strategies.
