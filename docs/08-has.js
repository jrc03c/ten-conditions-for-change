	description: `
		<p>We're very unlikely to perform a specific action unless we have the resources we need to perform that action effectively.</p>

		<p>There are a number of different things we may fail to have that can prevent us from performing an action:</p>
		
		<ul type="A">
			<li><b>Money</b> - e.g., there may be a cost associated with the action, such as a gym membership fee</li>
			<li><b>Supplies</b> - e.g., we may need supplies or equipment to perform the action, such as dumbbells for exercise</li>
			<li><b>Technology</b> - e.g., we might not be able to perform the action without sufficiently up-to-date technology, such as a smart phone that's modern enough to run the latest apps</li>
			<li><b>Assistance</b> - e.g., if we can't carry an action out alone, we may require assistance; for instance, a person who has severely impaired vision may need assistance in navigating environments that are made for sighted people</li>
			<li><b>Transportation</b> - e.g., if we can't get to the right location, we may not be able to perform the required action</li>
			<li><b>Permission</b> - e.g., if we can't get the necessary permission to perform an action, such as parental permission for a child or a boss's permission for employees, we may not be able to perform the action</li>
			<li><b>Legal Authorization</b> - e.g., if an action goes against rules, laws, or regulations, we are unlikely to be able to carry it out even if it doesn't harm anyone and is beneficial</li>
		</ul>
