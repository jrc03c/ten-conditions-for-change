	content: `
		Below, we've laid out how to use this framework to create a new, positive behavior, whether in your own life or in the lives of a target population. These steps assume that you already have a desired behavior in mind that you know would create significant benefits (if it was adopted).

		If you don't already have a desired behavior in mind, or if you are unsure that the behavior you have in mind would create significant benefits, then we recommend instead starting by writing down an outcome or benefit that you'd like to achieve. Next, brainstorm a list of many possible behaviors that could lead to that outcome. Once you've come up with a list of possible behaviors, pick the behavior that you believe would yield the largest positive benefit relative to how difficult you think it would be to create that behavior. Then, carry out the following steps on the chosen behavior.

		To simplify this process, we've created [an interactive program](https://www.guidedtrack.com/programs/1ttwh43/run) to help you walk through these steps!

		Once you've got the desired behavior in mind, you're ready to begin!

		**Step 1: Select Behavior**

		Pick a concrete, positive behavior you'd like to create and a specific person or population who would ideally engage in this behavior. This behavior should be targeted at improving the world or (if the target person is you) improving your own life. Ideally, you should consider multiple options for positive behaviors, and then choose among them based on how much positive benefit you predict they would cause and how hard they would be to create.

		Alternatively, you could pick a past behavior change effort that failed and perform a "postmortem" analysis to try to figure out what went wrong with it. Ask yourself, "What positive outcome do I want? And what behavior adopted by which population would potentially achieve this outcome?" or "What behavior change did I fail to achieve in the past?"

		**Example:** If you hope to fight Hepatitis B, and parents in a given region often don't vaccinate their children, then you might decide that the behavior you want to create is for parents to bring their children in for Hepatitis B vaccinations.

		**Step 2: Consider <span class="is-highlighted is-orange">DECISION</span> Conditions**

		For each of the three conditions for change in the <span class="is-highlighted is-orange">DECISION</span> phase, ask yourself, "To what extent is this condition met by this person?" or "What percentage of people in this population meet this condition?"

		**Example:** If parents in your target region largely don't know about Hepatitis B vaccines for children, then you'll need to help them meet the "Considers" condition. If they do know about the vaccine but don't understand the benefit of vaccination, then you'll need to help them meet the "Desires" condition. If parents do want to vaccinate their children but don't know when or where to get the vaccines, and hence have no plan to follow through on vaccinating their children, then you'll need to help them meet the "Intends" condition.

		<hr class="little">

		**Step 3: Break Behavior into <span class="is-highlighted is-green">ACTION</span> Sequences**

		Then, break the behavior down into a series of actions that a person can perform to fully succeed at the behavior.

		Note that most complex behaviors will require a number of different actions to be performed. Furthermore, there might be multiple sequences of actions that could lead a person to succeed at this behavior, so you'll want to choose the sequence of actions that is easiest to implement and that is still sufficient for engaging in the desired behavior. Ask yourself, "Of all of the sequences of actions that could produce this behavior, which one makes the most sense in this situation? Which one is easiest to carry out?"

		**Example:** Vaccination might be accomplished in multiple ways. In some areas, both doctors and drugstores offer vaccination. In some cases, insurance companies may have to be consulted. You may decide that, given the particulars of your target region, visiting a local doctor who will bill the vaccination to a person's insurance company makes the most sense and is the easiest and most cost-effective course of action for most people. Also, the HepB vaccine in particular requires three separate doses at zero, one, and six to twelve months after birth. So, a prescribed sequence of actions might be: (1) Allow doctors to administer the first dose within twenty-four hours of birth in the hospital (unless the child has a low birth weight, in which case postpone all doses by a month); (2) visit your local family doctor or pediatrician for the second dose a month after the child is born; and (3) visit your local family doctor or pediatrician for the third dose six months after the child is born.

		<hr class="little">

		**Step 4: Consider <span class="is-highlighted is-green">ACTION</span> Conditions**

		Once you have settled on a sequence of actions that constitute the positive behavior, then you'll want to think about those actions individually. For each distinct type of action, consider each of the six conditions for change in the <span class="is-highlighted is-green">ACTION</span> phase, and ask yourself, "To what extent is this condition met by this person?" or "What percentage of people in this population meet this condition?"

		**Example:** If parents allow the first dose to be administered in the hospital but will likely forget the second and third doses, then you'll need to help them meet the "Remembers" condition. If parents don't understand why three doses are necessary, then you'll need to help them meet the "Believes" condition. If parents are inclined to put off the latter doses, then you'll need to help them meet the "Chooses" condition. If parents don't have health insurance and don't know how to sign up for it, then you'll need to help them meet the "Has" and "Knows" conditions. If the parents don't speak the local language, then you'll need to help them meet the "Embodies" condition. (The main type of action in the case of vaccination is visiting the doctor to receive the vaccination; if there were multiple types of actions, then you'd need to consider the above conditions for each type.)

		<hr class="little">

		**Step 5: Consider the <span class="is-highlighted is-purple">CONTINUATION</span> Condition**

		Then, review the condition for change in the <span class="is-highlighted is-purple">CONTINUATION</span> phase, and ask yourself, "Is it likely that the conditions in the <span class="is-highlighted is-orange">DECISION</span> and <span class="is-highlighted is-green">ACTION</span> phase may shift for the worse as time passes or as some of the actions are completed? If so, when, where, and how will the process break down in the future?"

		**Example:** If any of the above conditions might become un-met as time passes, then you'll have to find ways to help parents re-meet those conditions. For example, if children have negative reactions to the first doses of the vaccine and parents become worried about allowing their children to receive the second and third doses, then you'll have to find ways to help them re-meet the "Desires," "Believes," and/or "Chooses" conditions. Or if the government decides to stop subsidizing healthcare and a significant portion of the population loses access to health insurance, then you'll have to find ways to help them re-meet the "Has" condition.

		<hr class="little">

		**Step 6: Choose Strategies**

		As you review all of the conditions mentioned, keep in mind that it often turns out that some of the conditions will already be met automatically and so require no work, whereas others will only be met if appropriate interventions are used.

		The conditions for change that you think are not already well met provide hypotheses about how to increase the chance that the behavior will be changed. For each condition that is not well met, consider the provided example strategies for improving that condition, or brainstorm your own strategies. Consider which strategies seem promising regarding the intended behavior change for the intended population given each strategy's likelihood of success and difficulty of implementation. Now, ask yourself, "Given all of the conditions for change that are not well met and all of the relevant strategies for meeting that condition, which would be the most effective for me to work on? Which do I predict will provide the biggest expected improvements in behavior change relative to their cost, effort, or difficulty of implementation?"

		**Example:** If parents don't know about the HepB vaccine at all, then (to help them meet the "Considers" condition) you might run an ad campaign on TV or on a major social network. If parents are likely to forget about the second and third dose appointments, then (to help them meet the "Remembers" condition) you might remind them with text message, email, and phone call reminders. If parents falsely believe that the vaccine will cause their children to develop autism, then (to help them meet the "Desires," "Believes," and/or "Chooses" conditions) you might develop and distribute a free pamphlet that obstetricians can give to new mothers that clearly explains the benefits of vaccinations.
