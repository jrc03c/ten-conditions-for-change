	content: `
		The Ten Conditions for Change framework can be used for two purposes. First, it can be used to create a new behavior in a target population; and second, it can be used to perform a "postmortem" analysis to try to figure out why a past attempted behavior change failed.

		Here is a step-by-step guide for using the Ten Conditions for Change to create a new, beneficial behavior:

		<hr class="little">

		**Step 1: Choose a Target Population**

		Select a population or person (it could be yourself!) who you are aiming to benefit via positive behavior change.

		**Example:** Perhaps your target population is children in your region who are suffering from high numbers of cases of Hepatitis B.

		<hr class="little">

		**Step 2: Consider the Desired Outcomes & Brainstorm Behaviors**

		If you have already selected the behavior you are aiming to create in the target population, and you are confident it is a good choice to produce positive outcomes (relative to its difficulty of implementation) skip now to step 4.

		Otherwise, we recommend writing down the primary positive outcome or benefit that you're aiming to create for the target population.

		Once you have done that, brainstorm a list of many possible new behaviors (or behaviors that are currently only done infrequently) that could lead to that positive outcome or benefit.

		After you've come up with this list of possible target behaviors, for each one consider:

		<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
			<li>how much benefit it would create for the target population if they were to engage in this behavior reliably, and</li>
			<li>how difficult it would be to create that behavior.</li>
		</ol>

		**Example:** If your target outcome is a reduction in cases of Hepatitis B among children in your region, you might consider target behaviors like (i) parental testing (to prevent transmission to children), (ii) early childhood vaccination, or (iii) adolescent vaccination.

		<hr class="little">

		**Step 3: Select the Behavior**

		Of the list of concrete, positive behaviors you brainstormed, pick the one that you believe has the best ratio of positive outcomes for your target population relative to its difficulty of implementation.

		**Example:** If you hope to fight Hepatitis B, and parents in your region often don't vaccinate their children, then you might decide that the behavior you want to create is for parents to bring their children in for Hepatitis B vaccinations at the appropriate times.

		<hr class="little">

		**Step 4: Consider <span class="is-highlighted is-orange">DECISION</span> Conditions**

		Now we are going to apply the <span class="is-highlighted is-orange">DECISION</span> phase of the Ten Conditions for Change framework to the behavior that you selected. For each of the three conditions for change in the <span class="is-highlighted is-orange">DECISION</span> phase, ask yourself, "To what extent is this condition met by this person?" or "What percentage of people in this population meet this condition?"

		**Example:** If parents in your target region largely don't know about Hepatitis B vaccines for children, then you'll need to help them meet the "Considers" condition. If they do know about the vaccine but don't understand the benefit of vaccination, then you'll need to help them meet the "Desires" condition. If parents do want to vaccinate their children but don't know when or where to get the vaccines, and hence have no plan to follow through on vaccinating their children, then you'll need to help them meet the "Intends" condition.

		<hr class="little">

		**Step 5: Break Behavior into <span class="is-highlighted is-green">ACTION</span> Sequences**

		Then, break the behavior down into a series of actions that a person can perform to fully succeed at the behavior.

		Note that most complex behaviors will require a number of different actions to be performed. Furthermore, there might be multiple sequences of actions that could lead a person to succeed at this behavior, so you'll want to choose the sequence of actions that is easiest to implement and that is still sufficient for engaging in the desired behavior. Ask yourself, "Of all of the sequences of actions that could produce this behavior, which one makes the most sense in this situation? Which one is easiest to carry out?"

		**Example:** Vaccination might be accomplished in multiple ways. In some areas, both doctors and drugstores offer vaccination. In some cases, insurance companies may have to be consulted. You may decide that, given the particulars of your target region, visiting a local doctor who will bill the vaccination to a person's insurance company makes the most sense and is the easiest and most cost-effective course of action for most people. Also, the HepB vaccine in particular requires three separate doses at zero, one, and six to twelve months after birth. So, a prescribed sequence of actions might be: (1) Allow doctors to administer the first dose within twenty-four hours of birth in the hospital (unless the child has a low birth weight, in which case postpone all doses by a month); (2) visit your local family doctor or pediatrician for the second dose a month after the child is born; and (3) visit your local family doctor or pediatrician for the third dose six months after the child is born.

		<hr class="little">

		**Step 6: Consider <span class="is-highlighted is-green">ACTION</span> Conditions**

		Once you have settled on a sequence of actions that constitute the positive behavior, then you'll want to think about those actions individually. For each distinct type of action, consider each of the six conditions for change in the <span class="is-highlighted is-green">ACTION</span> phase, and ask yourself, "To what extent is this condition met by this person?" or "What percentage of people in this population meet this condition?"

		**Example:** If parents allow the first dose to be administered in the hospital but will likely forget the second and third doses, then you'll need to help them meet the "Remembers" condition. If parents don't understand why three doses are necessary, then you'll need to help them meet the "Believes" condition. If parents are inclined to put off the latter doses, then you'll need to help them meet the "Chooses" condition. If parents don't have health insurance and don't know how to sign up for it, then you'll need to help them meet the "Has" and "Knows" conditions. If the parents don't speak the local language, then you'll need to help them meet the "Embodies" condition. (The main type of action in the case of vaccination is visiting the doctor to receive the vaccination; if there were multiple types of actions, then you'd need to consider the above conditions for each type.)

		<hr class="little">

		**Step 7: Consider the <span class="is-highlighted is-purple">CONTINUATION</span> Condition**

		Then, review the condition for change in the <span class="is-highlighted is-purple">CONTINUATION</span> phase, and ask yourself, "Is it likely that the conditions in the <span class="is-highlighted is-orange">DECISION</span> and <span class="is-highlighted is-green">ACTION</span> phase may shift for the worse as time passes or as some of the actions are completed? If so, when, where, and how will the process break down in the future?"

		**Example:** If any of the above conditions might become un-met as time passes, then you'll have to find ways to help parents re-meet those conditions. For example, if children have negative reactions to the first doses of the vaccine and parents become worried about allowing their children to receive the second and third doses, then you'll have to find ways to help them re-meet the "Desires," "Believes," and/or "Chooses" conditions. Or if the government decides to stop subsidizing healthcare and a significant portion of the population loses access to health insurance, then you'll have to find ways to help them re-meet the "Has" condition.

		<hr class="little">

		**Step 8: Choose Strategies**

		As you review all of the conditions mentioned, keep in mind that it often turns out that some of the conditions will already be met automatically and so require no work, whereas others will only be met if appropriate interventions are used.

		The conditions for change that you think are not already well met provide hypotheses about how to increase the chance that the behavior will be changed. For each condition that is not well met, consider the provided example strategies for improving that condition, or brainstorm your own strategies. Consider which strategies seem promising regarding the intended behavior change for the intended population given each strategy's likelihood of success and difficulty of implementation. Now, ask yourself, "Given all of the conditions for change that are not well met and all of the relevant strategies for meeting that condition, which would be the most effective for me to work on? Which do I predict will provide the biggest expected improvements in behavior change relative to their cost, effort, or difficulty of implementation?"

		**Example:** If parents don't know about the HepB vaccine at all, then (to help them meet the "Considers" condition) you might run an ad campaign on TV or on a major social network. If parents are likely to forget about the second and third dose appointments, then (to help them meet the "Remembers" condition) you might remind them with text message, email, and phone call reminders. If parents falsely believe that the vaccine will cause their children to develop autism, then (to help them meet the "Desires," "Believes," and/or "Chooses" conditions) you might develop and distribute a free pamphlet that obstetricians can give to new mothers that clearly explains the benefits of vaccinations.
