		[Ideas42](https://www.ideas42.org/) developed the [Behavioral Design Process](https://www.ideas42.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/BDT_Playbook_FINAL-digital.pdf) to help governments use behavioral design to advance the positive goals of their policies and programs.

		They propose creating Behavior Design Teams (BDTs), which are cross-agency groups of behavioral designers and policymakers who focus on translating research into policy proposals that improve existing programs or create new beneficial programs.

		For each individual project, the behavioral design process has five stages:

		1. **Define**: Develop a statement defining what the problem is (for a specific population) that you are trying to solve, without making assumptions about the reasons why the problem exists. For example: "Entrepreneurs register for business courses, but do not attend the first class. The behavior is specific (people sign up, but don't attend); the population is specific (entrepreneurs who register for the class), and there's no presumption about why they are not attending, nor about what an appropriate solution would be."
		2. **Diagnose**: Generate hypotheses about the bottlenecks that keep people in the target population from adopting the relevant behaviors by using quantitative and qualitative methods. For instance, this can be done using the proprietary technique the authors call "behavioral mapping," which is designed to "pinpoint discrete decision and action points in a process. For each of these points, [they then] use insights from behavioral science to identify psychological factors and contextual features that might affect choice and action."
		3. **Design**: Create interventions that address the previously diagnosed bottlenecks. Pragmatic factors will need to be taken into account during the design phase, such as "your timeline, available resources, and the potential for the intervention to scale." It is important to build prototypes of the interventions and user-test them to see how the population interacts with them and to potentially uncover new bottlenecks. As new information is learned about the end user, you may have to return temporarily to the *Diagnose* phase.
		4. **Test**: Determine the extent to which the interventions worked to help solve the problem that was identified during the *Define* phase. When feasible, it is recommended to use randomized control trials (RCTs) to evaluate the impact of the interventions.
		5. **Scale**: Expand the scope of successful interventions by applying them to larger populations or in new contexts. However, rather than rushing into full scale prematurely, it is often wise to replicate the *Test* phase at a larger scale or in whatever new context you may want to apply it, in addition to looking for opportunities to further improve the interventions. It is also important to use "Cost-effectiveness analyses, [which] can help estimate upfront and continuing costs so that agencies can make informed decisions on how and where they want to scale."

		**Connection**: The Behavioral Design Process has been designed for a specific (yet powerful) application of behavioral science, which is to help improve public programs and policies, though it surely can be adapted to other domains as well. Like Intervention Mapping, it is a process that runs from the identification of the problem through the implementation of the interventions. During the *Diagnose* stage of the project, the Behavioral Design Team must understand why the population is not exhibiting the desired behavior, and the Ten Conditions for Change framework may be a useful diagnostic tool to help identify behavioral bottlenecks. And during the *Design* phase, the Ten Conditions for Change framework can be used to identify potential interventions that could be applied to help create the behavior.
