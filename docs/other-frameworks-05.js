		The [Wise Interventions](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/59de5a0cc164e3000177d2a1/5bd27f16eb34b0708083051b_waltonwilson2018.pdf) approach by [Gregory M. Walton](http://gregorywalton-stanford.weebly.com/) and [Timothy D. Wilson](http://www.people.virginia.edu/~tdw/) organizes behavior change strategies in a [helpful searchable database](https://www.wiseinterventions.org/#What-are-Wise-Intervention). These Wise Interventions are meant to "help people draw adaptive meanings," enabling them to "accomplish their goals and flourish" via interventions that "focus on the meanings and inferences people draw about themselves, other people, or a situation they are in." In particular, interventions are grouped based on three primary motivations, each of which has sub-motivations:

		- *Need to understand*, which capitalizes on people's motivation to understand themselves, others, and the world around them. It subdivides into:
			- understand selves (my own self and the selves of others)
			- understand other people and groups
			- understand personal and social experiences
		- *Need for self-integrity*, which focuses on desire to think well of oneself - to believe you are adequate, moral, competent and coherent. It subdivides into:
			- remedy threats to self-integrity that undermine functioning
			- link self-integrity to a behavior or attitude to motivate positive change
		- *Need to belong*, which focuses on desire to feel connected to others, to be accepted and included, to be valuable members of social groups, and to contribute to the lives of others. It subdivides into:
			- remedy threats to belonging that undermine function
			- link belonging to a behavior or attitude that motivates positive change

		**Connection**: The Wise Interventions approach is related to the Ten Conditions for Change framework in that one can apply Wise Interventions with the goal of influencing any of the ten conditions in our model.
