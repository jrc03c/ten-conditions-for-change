		We're very unlikely to attempt a specific action if we don't think that attempting it will help us to achieve a desired outcome. We may fail to believe that attempting an action will help us achieve a desired outcome for various reasons:

		<ol type="A">
			<li><b>Lack of Perceived Connection to Goal</b>—e.g., we may think "I don't see how carrying out this action will actually help me achieve my goal"</li>
			<li><b>Lack of Self-Efficacy</b>—e.g., we may think "I'll probably fail if I try to perform this action"</li>
		</ol>
