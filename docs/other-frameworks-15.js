		The [COM-B system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3096582/) (and the related "Behavior Change Wheel") were released by [Susan Michie](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/antimicrobial-resistance/people/susan-michie), [Maartje van Stralen](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/maartje-van-stralen), and Robert West in 2011. It is a behavior change framework designed to be comprehensive (with the goal of being applicable to every intervention that "has been or could be developed"), coherent ("in that its categories are all exemplars of the same type of entity and have a broadly similar level of specificity"), and to have a clear link to an overarching model of behavior (in this case, based on "three factors that were necessary and sufficient prerequisites for the performance of a specified volitional behaviour", derived from "a US consensus meeting of behavioural theorists in 1991, and a principle of US criminal law dating back many centuries"). The COM-B system was "developed from 19 frameworks of behavior change identified in a systematic literature review."

		In the COM-B system, there are nine basic categories of interventions that can be deployed to try to influence behavior:

		1. **Education**: "Increasing knowledge or understanding."
			 - e.g., "Providing information to promote healthy eating."
		2. **Persuasion**: "Using communication to induce positive or negative feelings or stimulate action."
			 - e.g., "Using imagery to motivate increases in physical activity."
		3. **Incentivization**: "Creating expectations of reward."
			 - e.g., "Using prize draws to induce attempts to stop smoking."
		4. **Coercion**: "Creating expectations of punishment or cost."
			 - e.g., "Raising the financial cost to reduce excessive alcohol consumption."
		5. **Training**: "Imparting skills."
			 - e.g., "Advanced driver training to increase safe driving."
		6. **Restriction**: "Using rules to reduce the opportunity to engage in the target behavior (or to increase the target behavior by reducing the opportunity to engage in competing behaviors)"
			 - e.g., "Prohibiting sales of solvents to people under 18 to reduce use for intoxication."
		7. **Environmental Restructuring**: "Changing the physical or social context."
			 - e.g., "Providing on-screen prompts for GPs to ask about smoking behavior."
		8. **Modeling**: "Providing an example for people to aspire to or imitate."
			 - e.g., "Using TV drama scenes involving safe-sex practices to increase condom use."
		9. **Enablement**: "Increasing means / reducing barriers to increase capability [beyond education and training] or opportunity [beyond environmental restructuring]."
			 - e.g., "Behavioural support for smoking cessation, medication for cognitive deficits, surgery to reduce obesity, prostheses to promote physical activity."

		In the COM-B system (which stands for "Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, and Behavior”), there are three necessary and sufficient prerequisites for the performance of a specified volitional behavior, and each of these prerequisites can be subdivided into two parts, forming six different characteristics that can be targeted by interventions:

		- **Capability** ("the individual's psychological and physical capacity to engage in the activity concerned"), subdivided into _Physical Capability_ (the physical characteristics needed to carry out a behavior) and _Psychological Capability_ ("the capacity to engage in the necessary thought processes - comprehension, reasoning, etc."). To influence Capability, one can use interventions related to Education, Training, and Enablement.
		- **Opportunity** ("all the factors that lie outside the individual that make the behavior possible or prompt it"), subdivided into _Physical Opportunity_ ("physical opportunity afforded by the environment") and _Social Opportunity_ ("social opportunity afforded by the cultural milieu that dictates the way that we think about things, e.g., the words and concepts that make up our language"). To influence Opportunity, one can use interventions related to Restriction, Environmental Restructuring, and Enablement.
		- **Motivation** ("those brain processes that energize and direct behavior, not just goals and conscious decision-making"), subdivided into _Automatic Motivation_ ("involving emotions and impulses that arise from associative learning and/or innate dispositions") and _Reflective Motivation_ ("involving evaluations and plans"). To influence Automatic Motivation, one can use interventions related to Persuasion, Incentivisation, Coercion, Environmental Restructuring, Modeling, or Enablement. To influence Reflective Motivation, one can use interventions related to Education, Persuasion, Incentivisation, or Coercion.

		Finally, in the COM-B system, there are seven different categories of policies, which are defined as "actions on the part of responsible authorities that enable or support interventions." These are:

		1. **Communication / marketing** ("Using print, electronic, telephonic or broadcast media.")
			 - e.g., "Conducting mass media campaigns."
		2. **Guidelines** ("Creating documents that recommend or mandate practice. This includes all changes to service provision.")
			 - e.g., "Producing and disseminating treatment protocols."
		3. **Fiscal** ("Using the tax system to reduce or increase the financial cost.")
			 - e.g., "Increasing duty or increasing anti-smuggling activities."
		4. **Regulation** ("Establishing rules or principles of behavior or practice.")
			 - e.g., "Establishing voluntary agreements on advertising."
		5. **Legislation** ("Making or changing laws.")
			 - e.g., "Prohibiting sale or use."
		6. **Environmental / social planning** ("Designing and/or controlling the physical or social environment.")
			 - e.g., "Using town planning."
		7. **Service provision** ("Delivering a service.")
			 - e.g., "Establishing support services in workplaces, communities, etc."

		The Behavior Change Wheel (BCW) is a way of presenting the COM-B framework as a wheel consisting of different layers. The BCW "provides a systematic way of identifying relevant intervention functions and policy categories based on what is understood about the target behavior." You can learn more about the Behavior Change Wheel [here](http://www.behaviourchangewheel.com/about-wheel). As it explains:

		> The [inner] hub [of the wheel] identifies the sources of the behavior that could prove fruitful targets for intervention. It uses the COM-B ('capability', 'opportunity', 'motivation' and 'behaviour') model. This model recognizes that behavior is part of an interacting system involving all these components. Interventions need to change one or more of them in such a way as to put the system into a new configuration and minimize the risk of it reverting. Surrounding the hub is a layer of nine intervention functions to choose from based on the particular COM-B analysis one has undertaken. The outer layer, the rim of the wheel, identifies seven policy categories that can support the delivery of these intervention functions.

		**Connection**: The COM-B system's three necessary and sufficient factors for the performance of a behavior - Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation - reflect a (less detailed) way of categorizing a number of the conditions found in the Ten Conditions framework. The Capability factor is closely related to our Embodies condition (and perhaps our Knows condition as well). The Motivation factor is essentially the same as our Desires condition. Finally, the Opportunity factor (which incorporates "all the factors that lie outside the individual that make the behavior possible or prompt it") could, depending on one's interpretation of the Opportunity factor, encompass our Has condition, and possibly elements of our Considers, Desires, Intends, Remembers, and Believes conditions.
