		The [EAST](https://www.behaviouralinsights.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BIT-Publication-EAST_FA_WEB.pdf) framework from the [Behavioral Insights Team](https://www.bi.team/) provides four simple, useful ways to apply behavioral insights that can be relatively easily adopted in government and public policy.

		This framework advocates that you:

		1. Define the outcome you are trying to impact
		2. Understand the context (from the perspective of those whose behaviors you are seeking to change)
		3. Build the intervention iteratively using the EAST factors (listed below)
		4. Test (to measure the effectiveness of the result), learn, and adapt

		To apply EAST, you should design your intended behaviors to be:

		- **E**asy (e.g., by applying defaults, reducing hassle, and simplifying messages)
		- **A**ttractive (e.g., by attracting attention and providing incentives)
		- **S**ocial (e.g., by showing that most people engage in the behavior, by leveraging existing person-to-person networks, and by encouraging people to make social commitments to others)
		- **T**imely (e.g., by prompting people at the times they are most likely to be receptive, by adjusting immediate costs and benefits of action for those the intervention is reaching, and by getting people to identify barriers to action and plan a solution)

		**Connection**: The EAST framework is related to the Ten Conditions for Change framework in that EAST can provide a variety of helpful strategies for influencing a number of our ten conditions.
