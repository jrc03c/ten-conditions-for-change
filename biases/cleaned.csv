To make a behavior likely, it's critical to have at least one of these two forms of desires, but it's best if the person desires the behavior in both the intuitive and reflective senses."

Attentional Bias,Anchoring Bias,Bandwagon Effect,"I would show them how people who suffer from the same attentional biases that they do have benefitted tremendously from adopting the new positive habit. For example, if my friend suffered from anxiety then I would show them a video of other long term anxiety suffers who decided to adopt the habit of meditating every morning. They would demonstrate how much more relaxed their faces and bodies were. They would show how much more open and loving their interactions within their social circles have become. I feel that once my friend recognizes themselves within these similar individuals then they would be much more likely to adopt the habit. I would also reach out to a support group to find them an accountability partner so that they could connect over their meditation journey and how it helps them overcome some of the anxiety that they experience.",5.

I would tell them that if they agree to join a mediation group and tell my friend about how it has cured their anxiety then I will give them a reward. I would pay for a fancy dinner for all of them as soon as my friend decided to jump on the bandwagon and join the class as well. Once my friend participated in a few classes and enjoyed the company of their friends as well then their friends could feel free to leave the class.,8.
