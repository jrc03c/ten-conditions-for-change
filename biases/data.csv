A person *chooses* to perform the relevant actions instead of performing other actions. Even if a person remembers to perform an action, they're very unlikely to perform that action unless they choose it over the other actions or opportunities that are available to them at the same time. | 2. A person *desires* to adopt the new behavior. Even if a person has considered adopting a new behavior, they're very unlikely to actually do so unless they desire to adopt it. There are two different types of desire: /intuitive desire/ (a gut-level positive feeling or emotion about engaging in a behavior) and /reflective desire/ (an analytical, reasoned belief that the behavior is worthwhile). To make a behavior likely, it's critical to have at least one of these two forms of desires, but it's best if the person desires the behavior in both the intuitive and reflective senses. | 5. A person *believes* (1) that the relevant actions have a significant connection to the adoption of the new behavior and (2) that they themselves are able to perform the actions. A person is very unlikely to attempt a specific action if they don't think that attempting it will help them to achieve the desired outcome."

For example, the probability of being either a physics or a biology major is at least as likely as being a physics major, if not more likely. However, when a personality description (data) seems to be very representative of a physics major (e.g., pocket protector) over a biology major, people judge that it is more likely for this person to be a physics major than a natural sciences major (which is a superset of physics).<br><br>Further evidence that the Representativeness Heuristic may be causal to the Disjunction Fallacy comes from Bar-Hillel and Neter (1986).

When the subjects believed that the writers freely chose the positions they took (for or against Castro), they naturally rated the people who spoke in favor of Castro as having a more positive attitude towards Castro.

For example, the illusion is weaker for depressed individuals and is stronger when individuals have an emotional need to control the outcome. <br><br>To investigate perceptions of control, experimenters may ask people about hypothetical situations, for example the likelihood of their involvement in a motor vehicle accident. On average, drivers regard accidents as much less likely in &quot;high-control&quot; situations, such as when they are driving, than in &quot;low-control&quot; situations, such as when they are in the passenger seat. They also rate a high-control accident, such as driving into the car in front, as much less likely than a low-control accident such as being hit from behind by another driver.</div><br>"",""source"":""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_control"",""groupName"":""IllusionOfControl""}",,,,,,31,desktop,male,completedBachelorsDegree,695e0c0f,2020-11-17 02:12 PM,023c3895f47829e07c0cd351e1a2b72d63efd216,4160fb8a,1989,60562bc3,5,United States,"$40,000 to $59,999",0,3,50000,,

Some studies suggest that losses are twice as powerful, psychologically, as gains. Whether a transaction is framed as a loss or a gain is very important: would you rather get a $5 discount (win), or avoid a $5 surcharge (loss)? The same change in price framed differently has a significant effect on consumer behavior. In other words, losses have a more profound effect on us than does a gain of the same value. Recent studies have questioned the existence of loss aversion. One found that loss aversion does not exist in small payoff magnitudes. Another found that loss aversion is more likely to affect a person in competitive situations.

However, when a personality description (data) seems to be very representative of a physics major (e.g., pocket protector) over a biology major, people judge that it is more likely for this person to be a physics major than a natural sciences major (which is a superset of physics).<br><br>Further evidence that the Representativeness Heuristic may be causal to the Disjunction Fallacy comes from Bar-Hillel and Neter (1986). They found that people judge a person who is highly representative of being a statistics major (e.g., highly intelligent, does math competitions) as being more likely to be a statistics major than a social sciences major (superset of statistics), but they do not think that he is more likely to be a Hebrew language major than a humanities major (superset of Hebrew language).

To ethically leverage the Spotlight Fallacy to help someone to adopt a new positive habit or pattern of behavior, I would go with him the first time to prove to him that gyms aren't only for people who are in shape, but for people who are out of shape too. I would tell him to look around and see all of the overweight and underweight people (without being too obvious about it) so he could become more comfortable. If that's too much for him, I would tell him there are plenty of options for working out at home, like exercise DVDs, Youtube exercise videos, and books that teach you bodyweight exercises. | I think if a person were deeply giving and really believed that charities are great for society, they might see a Hostile Media Effect when you see all of those reports about CEOs of charities like Goodwill making millions of dollars and a large portion of the donation money going to overhead instead of the actual cause. If they want to start giving to charity but they're hesitant to give because of the hostile media effect, I would help them to do some research on charities that shows the percentage of their dollars that goes to the charity itself rather than the higher-ups and for advertising. Some charities are better than others. All he would need is to be shown which ones are the best. I would just show him that the charities that are shown in the media are just the worst ones, not the best. | If I had a friend who was trying to manage his anger, but wasn't willing to go to therapy because he thinks all therapists are head shrinkers who want to poke around in his brain and do some damage, I would just help him to understand that he needed to get his anger under control and a therapist is just there to talk to him and offer tools to manage his rage. I would also show him that talking with a third party who doesn't have a vested interest in his life would allow him to express himself and offer a certain release valve to get rid of his aggression before he explodes.","6.

From probability theory, the disjunction of two events is at least as likely as either of the events individually. For example, the probability of being either a physics or a biology major is at least as likely as being a physics major, if not more likely. However, when a personality description (data) seems to be very representative of a physics major (e.g., pocket protector) over a biology major, people judge that it is more likely for this person to be a physics major than a natural sciences major (which is a superset of physics).<br><br>Further evidence that the Representativeness Heuristic may be causal to the Disjunction Fallacy comes from Bar-Hillel and Neter (1986). They found that people judge a person who is highly representative of being a statistics major (e.g., highly intelligent, does math competitions) as being more likely to be a statistics major than a social sciences major (superset of statistics), but they do not think that he is more likely to be a Hebrew language major than a humanities major (superset of Hebrew language).

When the subjects believed that the writers freely chose the positions they took (for or against Castro), they naturally rated the people who spoke in favor of Castro as having a more positive attitude towards Castro.
