A person *chooses* to perform the relevant actions instead of performing other actions. Even if a person remembers to perform an action, they're very unlikely to perform that action unless they choose it over the other actions or opportunities that are available to them at the same time. | 2. A person *desires* to adopt the new behavior. Even if a person has considered adopting a new behavior, they're very unlikely to actually do so unless they desire to adopt it. There are two different types of desire: /intuitive desire/ (a gut-level positive feeling or emotion about engaging in a behavior) and /reflective desire/ (an analytical, reasoned belief that the behavior is worthwhile). To make a behavior likely, it's critical to have at least one of these two forms of desires, but it's best if the person desires the behavior in both the intuitive and reflective senses. | 5. A person *believes* (1) that the relevant actions have a significant connection to the adoption of the new behavior and (2) that they themselves are able to perform the actions. A person is very unlikely to attempt a specific action if they don't think that attempting it will help them to achieve the desired outcome."
