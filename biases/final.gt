		Uh-oh! You didn't answer at least one of the quiz questions correctly! Please read the instructions again!

Welcome, and thanks for taking this survey! We really appreciate your time and effort!

In this survey, we'll describe to you three *cognitive biases*. Cognitive biases are flaws in your thinking that lead you to misinterpret information from the world around you and to come to inaccurate conclusions. For each cognitive bias, we'll describe the bias to you and then ask you two questions. 

First, we'll ask you to think about a scenario in which you're trying to help a friend or loved one to adopt a new positive habit or pattern of behavior, like going to the gym regularly, giving to charity each month, managing anger, meditating every morning, etc. Then we'll ask you to think about (1) ways that you could help that friend or loved one to /overcome/ the bias so that they can adopt the new habit or behavior, and/or (2) ways that you could ethically /leverage/ the bias to help the person to adopt the new habit or behavior.

For the second question, we'll ask you which of the Ten Conditions for Change that your bias corresponds to. (Don't worry; we'll tell you all about the Ten Conditions for Change when we get to those questions!)

-- EXAMPLE --
-------------

*header: Example

Let's pretend that there's a bias called the *Special Numbers Bias*, and most people experience it. The Special Numbers Bias is a subconscious preference for some numbers and a distaste for other numbers. For example, many people set their TV volume or radio volume to certain numbers, like multiples of 2 or 5. Other people have fear of certain "unlucky" numbers, like 13 or 666, and so will avoid using them whenever possible and will feel a (possibly subconscious) negative "vibe" about the context in which those numbers are presented to them. 

If you were trying to get a friend or loved one to adopt a new positive habit or pattern of behavior, how would you (1) help the person to /overcome/ the Special Numbers Bias in order to adopt the new habit or behavior, and/or (2) ethically /leverage/ the bias to help the person to adopt the new habit or behavior?

Well, you might give an answer like this: 

*html
	<style>
		blockquote {
			margin: 1em 0;
			padding: 1em;
			background-color: rgb(235, 235, 235);

		}

		hr {

			background-color: rgb(51, 51, 51) !important;
			padding: 1px !important;
			margin: 1em 0 2em 0;
		}
	</style>

	<blockquote>
		<h4>Answer</h4>

		<hr>

		<p>If a friend was trying to adopt the habit of going to the gym every day, I would try to help them to <i>overcome</i> the Special Numbers Bias by:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>trying to convince them that there's nothing special or scary about any particular numbers</li>
			<li>asking them to record daily numbers, like the number of reps they did on weights, the amount of time they ran for on the treadmill, the day of the month, their weight, and their mood or progress to show them that there's ultimately no correlation between positive or negative outcomes and certain numbers</li>
			<li>(if they can't be convinced by the above steps) allowing them to avoid any numbers they feel a negative vibe about, like allowing them to skip going to the gym on the 13th of every month, or allowing them to pick numbers of reps that don't incorporate any numbers they dislike</li>
		</ul>

		<p>I would try to <i>leverage</i> the Special Numbers Bias to help them begin going to the gym by:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>plan workouts that include their favorite numbers, like using numbers of reps that they like, or numbers of minutes on the treadmill that they like, etc.</li>
			<li>speak words of encouragement or praise or giving other kinds of rewards any time they get to a favorite number when doing reps or running on the treadmill or when they work out for a favorite number of days, etc.</li>
		</ul>

Whether a transaction is framed as a loss or a gain is very important: would you rather get a $5 discount (win), or avoid a $5 surcharge (loss)? The same change in price framed differently has a significant effect on consumer behavior. In other words, losses have a more profound effect on us than does a gain of the same value. Recent studies have questioned the existence of loss aversion. One found that loss aversion does not exist in small payoff magnitudes. Another found that loss aversion is more likely to affect a person in competitive situations.

The reason why an individual makes this mistake is that he or she will incorporate presently available information when evaluating a past decision. <br><br>Baron and Hershey (1988) presented subjects with hypothetical situations in order to test this. One such example involved a surgeon deciding whether or not to do a risky surgery on a patient. The surgery had a known probability of success. Subjects were presented with either a good or bad outcome (in this case living or dying), and asked to rate the quality of the surgeon's pre-operation decision. Those presented with bad outcomes rated the decision worse than those who were presented with good outcomes.</div><br>", "source" -> "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_bias", "groupName" -> "OutcomeBias"}

	*question: Imagine a scenario in which you're trying to help a friend or loved one to adopt a new positive habit or pattern of behavior, like going to the gym regularly, giving to charity each month, managing anger, meditating every morning, etc. If your friend or loved one was having trouble adopting the new habit or behavior because they were getting tripped up by the {bias["name"]}, then how would you help them to overcome that bias and adopt the new habit or behavior? Or if you could ethically leverage the {bias["name"]} to help the person to adopt the new habit or behavior, then how would you do it? Think: "To help a friend or loved one to overcome the {bias["name"]} and adopt a new positive habit or pattern of behavior, I would _____." Or, conversely (or additionally): "To ethically leverage the {bias["name"]} to help someone to adopt a new positive habit or pattern of behavior, I would _____." Please provide as much detail as you can!
		*tip: If you think about it for a while and can't imagine a way in which the {bias["name"]} has anything to do with adopting a new habit or behavior, then feel free to write something like "New behavior adoption isn't affected by this bias" in the answer box below.

		<h1 class="alert alert-danger">Question #2</h1>

	*question: The *Ten Conditions for Change* is a framework for helping people to adopt new positive behaviors or habits. The framework basically claims that if people have met all ten conditions, then they will adopt a new behavior. Given the definitions of the Ten Conditions for Change below and the definition of the {bias["name"]}, which of the Ten Conditions do you think is *most* affected by the {bias["name"]}? In other words, if a person is trying to adopt a new positive behavior but is failing to do so because they're suffering from the {bias["name"]}, then which of the Ten Conditions are they likely failing to meet? Or, conversely, if you could ethically leverage the {bias["name"]} to help someone adopt a new behavior, then which of the Ten Conditions would you most affect by leveraging the bias? (If you want, you can read more about the Ten Conditions for change [here|https://www.sparkwave.tech/conditions-for-change/].)
		*save: temp2
		1. A person *considers* the behavior. A person is very unlikely to change a behavior if they have not even considered changing it.
		2. A person *desires* to adopt the new behavior. Even if a person has considered adopting a new behavior, they're very unlikely to actually do so unless they desire to adopt it. There are two different types of desire: /intuitive desire/ (a gut-level positive feeling or emotion about engaging in a behavior) and /reflective desire/ (an analytical, reasoned belief that the behavior is worthwhile). To make a behavior likely, it's critical to have at least one of these two forms of desires, but it's best if the person desires the behavior in both the intuitive and reflective senses.
		3. A person *intends* to adopt the new behavior. Even if a person desires to adopt a new behavior, they're very unlikely to actually do so unless they themselves predict that they will conduct that behavior at specific times, in specific situations, or within a certain time frame.
		4. A person *remembers* to perform the actions that make up the new behavior. A person is unlikely to adopt a new behavior if they don't remember to perform the relevant actions at the right times.
		5. A person *believes* (1) that the relevant actions have a significant connection to the adoption of the new behavior and (2) that they themselves are able to perform the actions. A person is very unlikely to attempt a specific action if they don't think that attempting it will help them to achieve the desired outcome.
		6. A person *chooses* to perform the relevant actions instead of performing other actions. Even if a person remembers to perform an action, they're very unlikely to perform that action unless they choose it over the other actions or opportunities that are available to them at the same time.
		7. A person *knows* how to perform each action. A person is very unlikely to perform a specific action unless they have the information or knowledge needed to perform that action effectively.
		8. A person *has* the necessary resources and permission to perform the relevant actions. A person is very unlikely to perform a specific action unless they have the resources or permissions they need to perform that action effectively.
		9. A person *embodies* the skills and traits needed to perform the relevant actions. A person is very unlikely to perform a specific action unless they have the physical capacities, mental capabilities, and skills needed to perform that action.
		10. A person *maintains* all of the things needed to perform the relevant actions in the future. A person is very unlikely to perform future required actions if, due to the experience of taking earlier actions or due to the passage of time, the conditions mentioned above fall below adequate levels.
		None of the above. This bias doesn't affect any of the above conditions.
