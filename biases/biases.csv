Anchoring Bias,"A person's expectation about one thing is affected by something he/she saw, heard, or thought before. This occurs when people rely too heavily on a specific piece of information to govern their thought-process. 

In one study, an audience was asked to write the last two digits of their social security number and consider whether they would pay this number of dollars for items such as wine, chocolate, and computer equipment, the value of which they did not know. They were then asked to bid for these items. The result was that the audience members with higher two-digit numbers would submit bids that were between 60 percent and 120 percent higher than those with the lower social security numbers. Put simply, the higher the (social security) number in mind, the higher the bid. The social security numbers had become their ""anchors"".",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring
Attentional Bias,"Some information or evidence may hold a disproportionate amount of a person's attention because of that person's environment, and emotionally stimulating events/items within it.

In studies using the dot-probe paradigm, patients who suffered from chronic ailments such as anxiety were more likely to focus on information or stimuli representing their concerns (in the case of anxiety: worried facial expressions).

 A 'within-subjects' bias occurs when an individual displays greater bias toward one type of information (e.g., painful faces) when compared to different types of information (e.g., neutral faces). Alternatively, a 'between-subjects' bias, occurs when one group of participants displays greater bias than another group of participants (e.g., chronic pain patients showed greater bias towards painful expressions than did healthy control participants).",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attentional_Bias
Bandwagon Effect,"The Bandwagon Effect is the tendency to do or believe things because many other people do or believe the same. It is a phenomenon observed primarily within the fields of microeconomics, political science, and behaviorism. 

In Solomon Asch's Conformity Experiments, students who participated in ""vision tests"" were more likely to answer questions about the length of a line incorrectly if others in the same room (in this case, confederates of Asch) who answered the question first provided incorrect answers. Similarly, if at least one of the confederates gave the correct answer, the students became far more likely to also give the correct answer.","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagon_effect"
Bias Blind Spot,"This describes the tendency to see oneself as less biased than others. 

In Pronin's study at Princeton University, several biases were explained to subjects. When subsequently asked how biased they themselves were, subjects rated themselves as being much less prone to the biases described than the average person is prone.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_blind_spot
Choice-supportive Bias,"This is the tendency to remember one's choices as better than they actually were. Research indicates that the process of making and remembering choices yields memories that tend to be distorted in predictable ways. For example, one predictable way that memories of choices are distorted is that positive aspects tend to be remembered as part of the chosen option, regardless of whether they originally part of that option, and negative aspects tend to be remembered as part of rejected options. This may affect a person's regret or approval of past decisions, and may also influence future decision making.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice-supportive_bias
Confirmation Bias,"A tendency for people to favor information that confirms their preconceptions or hypotheses regardless of whether the information is true. 

Experiments have repeatedly found that people tend to test hypotheses in a one-sided way: by searching for evidence consistent with the hypothesis they have formed at a given time. Confirmation biases are not limited to the collection of evidence. Although two individuals may have the same information, the way they interpret it can be biased. Even if someone has sought and interpreted evidence in a neutral manner, he or she may still remember it selectively to reinforce his/her expectations. So, the Confirmation Bias may operate at three different stages: when gathering evidence, when analyzing the evidence, or when remembering the evidence.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias
Congruence Bias,"The tendency to test hypotheses exclusively through direct testing. Congruence Bias occurs due to people's over-reliance on direct testing of a given hypothesis and on a neglect of indirect testing. For example, in an experiment, a subject will test his own (usually) naive hypothesis again and again instead of trying to disprove it.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_bias
Contrast Effect,"A perception that is stronger or weaker, relative to objective measurement or typical experience, due to a prior or simultaneous exposure to a stimulus of less or greater value in the same dimension.

For example, as John Locke noted, lukewarm water may feel extremely hot or cold, depending on the temperature of your hand when you feel it. Similarly, a heavy weight is perceived as heavier than normal when felt at the same time as a lighter weight.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_effect
Denomination Effect,The Denomination Effect is a theoretical cognitive bias relating to currency: people are less likely to spend larger bills than their equivalent value in smaller bills.,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denomination_effect
Distinction Bias,"The tendency to view two options as more dissimilar when evaluating them simultaneously than when evaluating them separately. 

Research shows that options presented simultaneously are evaluated differently than the same options presented separately. For example, when televisions are displayed next to each other on the sales floor, the difference in quality between two very similar, high-quality televisions may appear great. A consumer may pay a much higher price for the higher-quality television, even though the difference in quality is imperceptible when the televisions are viewed in isolation.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinction_bias
Endowment Effect (aka Divestiture Aversion),"People place a higher value on objects that they own than on objects they do not. 

In one experiment, people demanded a higher price for a coffee mug that had been given to them, but put a lower price on one they did not yet own. The Endowment Effect was described as inconsistent with standard economic theory, which asserts that a person's willingness to pay for a good should be equal to their willingness to accept compensation to be deprived of the good.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect
Experimenter's or Expectation Bias,"This is the tendency for experimenters to believe, certify, and publish data that agree with their expectations for the outcome of an experiment, and to disbelieve, discard, or downgrade the corresponding weightings for data that appear to conflict with those expectations. In review of biases in clinical studies, David Sackett states that biases can occur in any one of seven stages of research:

  1. reading up on the field,
  2. specifying and selecting the study sample,
  3. executing the experimental maneuver (or exposure),
  4. measuring exposures and outcomes,
  5. analyzing the data,
  6. interpreting the analysis,
  7. publishing the results.

The inability of a human being to be objective is the ultimate source of this bias.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation_bias
Focusing Effect,"The Focusing Effect (or Focusing Illusion) is a cognitive bias that occurs when people place too much importance on one aspect of an event (especially, the aspect they happen to be thinking about at the moment). This error causes inaccuracy when predicting how useful a potential outcome will be.

In one experiment, when predicting relative happiness of Californians to themselves, Midwesterners predicted that Californians were more happy overall, because they were focusing on positive factors like the weather, while ignoring negative factors like crime rate.

The Focusing Effect is different from but related to the Attentional Bias: the Attentional Bias entails specific features of the environment, causing one to pay undue attention to certain things, whereas the Focusing Effect entails the mere process of thinking about something causing that thing to seem more important than it really is. One manifestation of the focusing effect can be summarized as, ""Things aren't as important as you think they are when you're thinking about them.""",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focusing_effect
Framing Effect,"Presenting the same option in different formats can alter people's decisions. Specifically, individuals have a tendency to make inconsistent choices, depending on whether the question is framed to concentrate on losses or gains. 

A set of experiments on framing indicated that different phrasing affected participants' responses to a question about a disease prevention strategy. Two options were presented to subjects, both describing the same statistical outcome, but one focused on the number of deaths, while the other focused on number of lives. Participants were much more likely to choose the option that ""saved"" lives.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_%28psychology%29
Hostile Media Effect (Disconfirmation Bias),"The tendency to see a media report as being biased due to one's own strong partisan views. 

In the first major study of this phenomenon, pro-Palestinian students and pro-Israeli students were shown the same news filmstrips pertaining to the then-recent (1982) Sabra and Shatila massacre of Palestinian refugees by Christian Lebanese militia fighters in Beirut during the Lebanese Civil War. On a number of objective measures, both sides found that these identical news clips were slanted in favor of the other side. This effect is interesting to psychologists because it appears to be a reversal of the otherwise pervasive effects of confirmation bias. I.e., in this area, people seem to pay more attention to information that contradicts rather than supports their existing views. 

This is an example of Disconfirmation Bias.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostile_media_effect
Hyperbolic Discounting,"Given two similar rewards, humans show a preference for one that arrives sooner rather than later. Humans are said to discount the value of the later reward, by a factor that increases with the length of the delay. 

The standard experiment used to reveal a test subject's hyperbolic discounting curve is to compare short-term preferences with long-term preferences. For instance: ""Would you prefer a dollar today or three dollars tomorrow?"" or ""Would you prefer a dollar in one year or three dollars in one year and one day?"" For certain ranges of offerings, a significant fraction of subjects will take the lesser amount today, but will gladly wait one extra day in a year in order to receive the higher amount instead.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_discounting
Illusion of Control,"The tendency to overestimate one's degree of influence over external events. The illusion is more common in familiar situations, and in situations where the person knows the desired outcome. The illusion can also be altered by emotional state. For example, the illusion is weaker for depressed individuals and is stronger when individuals have an emotional need to control the outcome. 

To investigate perceptions of control, experimenters may ask people about hypothetical situations, for example the likelihood of their involvement in a motor vehicle accident. On average, drivers regard accidents as much less likely in ""high-control"" situations, such as when they are driving, than in ""low-control"" situations, such as when they are in the passenger seat. They also rate a high-control accident, such as driving into the car in front, as much less likely than a low-control accident such as being hit from behind by another driver.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_control
Impact Bias,"The tendency to overestimate the length or the intensity of the impact of future feeling states. For example, people seem to think that if disaster strikes, it will take longer to recover emotionally than it actually does. Conversely, if a happy event occurs, people overestimate how long they will emotionally benefit from it.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_bias
Information Bias,"Involves e.g., distorted evaluation of information. Information Bias occurs due to people's curiosity and confusion of goals when trying to choose a course of action. An example of Information Bias is believing that the more information that can be acquired to make a decision, the better, even if that extra information is irrelevant for the decision. Examples of Information Bias are prevalent in medical diagnoses. Subjects in experiments concerning medical diagnostic problems show an information bias in which they seek information that is unnecessary in deciding the course of treatment.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_bias_%28psychology%29
Irrational Escalation (aka Escalation of Commitment) / Sunk Cost Fallacy,"The phenomenon where people justify increased investment in a decision based on the cumulative prior investment, despite new evidence suggesting that the cost (starting today) of continuing the decision outweighs the expected benefit. 

The term has been used to describe the United States commitment to military conflicts including Vietnam in the 1960s - 1970s and in Iraq in the 2000s, where dollars already spent and lives already lost ""justify"" continued involvement. (""We've already come this far..."")",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_escalation
Loss Aversion,"Loss aversion refers to people's tendency to strongly prefer avoiding losses to acquiring gains. Some studies suggest that losses are twice as powerful, psychologically, as gains. Whether a transaction is framed as a loss or a gain is very important: would you rather get a $5 discount (win), or avoid a $5 surcharge (loss)? The same change in price framed differently has a significant effect on consumer behavior. In other words, losses have a more profound effect on us than does a gain of the same value. Recent studies have questioned the existence of loss aversion. One found that loss aversion does not exist in small payoff magnitudes. Another found that loss aversion is more likely to affect a person in competitive situations. This is related to the Endowment Effect, and was once thought to be an consequence of it.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion
Mere Exposure Effect,"The tendency to express undue liking for things merely because of familiarity with them. 

Charles Goetzinger conducted an experiment using the Mere Exposure Effect on his class at Oregon State University. Goetzinger had a student come to class wearing a large black bag with only his feet visible. That student (student A) sat on a table in the back of the classroom. Goetzinger's experiment was to observe if the students would treat Student A in accordance with the Mere Exposure Effect. His hypothesis was confirmed. The students in the class first treated Student A with hostility, which over time turned into curiosity, and eventually friendship. This experiment confirms (Zajonc's) Mere Exposure Effect: by simply presenting the student wearing the black bag over and over again to the other students, their attitudes were changed.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere_exposure_effect
Money Illusion,"The tendency to concentrate on the nominal (face) value of money rather than its value in terms of purchasing power. Money Illusion can also influence people's perceptions of outcomes. Experiments have shown that people generally perceive a 2% cut in nominal income as unfair, but see a 2% rise in nominal income where there is 4% inflation as fair, despite them being almost rational equivalents.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_illusion
Moral Credential Effect,"An individual's track record as an egalitarian individual can establish a subconscious ethical certification, endorsement, or license within that individual which will increase their likelihood of making less egalitarian decisions later. For example, individuals who had the opportunity to recruit a woman or an African American in one setting were more likely to later say, in a different setting, that a job would be better suited for a man or a Caucasian.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_credential
Negativity Bias,"A psychological phenomenon by which humans pay more attention to and give more weight to negative rather than positive experiences or other kinds of information. For example, when given a piece of positive information and a piece of negative information about a stranger, people's judgment of the stranger will be negative, rather than neutral (assuming the two pieces of information are not severely imbalanced).",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias
Neglect of Probability,"The tendency to completely disregard probability when making a decision under uncertainty. With this bias, the actor completely disregards probability when making a decision, instead of using probability incorrectly. 

In one example of near-total neglect of probability, Rottenstreich and Hsee (2001) found that the typical subject was willing to pay $10 to avoid a 99% chance of a painful electric shock, and $7 to avoid a 1% chance of the same shock. (They suggest that probability is more likely to be neglected when the outcomes are emotion arousing.) The subject disregards probability in making his decision by treating each possible outcome as equal in his reasoning.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neglect_of_probability
Normalcy Bias,"A mental state people enter when facing a disaster which causes them to underestimate both the possibility of a disaster occurring and its possible effects. An assumption is made in the case of the Normalcy Bias that since a disaster never has occurred, it never will occur. It also results in a person's inability to cope with a disaster once it does occur. People with a normalcy bias have difficulties reacting to something they have not experienced before. People also tend to interpret warnings in the most optimistic way possible, seizing on any ambiguities to infer a less serious situation. The normalcy bias often results in unnecessary deaths in disaster situations. 

One example took place in New Orleans before Hurricane Katrina. Some examples of normalcy bias include inadequate government and citizen preparation, the denial that the levees could fail, and thousands of people's refusals to evacuate.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias
Omission Bias,"The tendency to judge harmful actions as worse, or less moral, than equally harmful omissions (inactions). It is contentious whether this represents a systematic error in thinking, or whether this is supported by a substantive moral theory. Spranca, Minsk, and Baron extended the omission bias to judgments of morality of choices. 

In one scenario, John, a tennis player, would be facing a tough opponent the next day in a decisive match. John knows that his opponent is allergic to a food substance. Subjects were presented with two conditions: John recommends the food containing the allergen to hurt his opponent's performance, or the opponent himself orders the allergenic food, and John says nothing. A majority of people judged that John's action of recommending the allergenic food as being more immoral than John's inaction of not informing the opponent of the allergenic substance.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omission_bias
Outcome Bias,"One will often judge a past decision by its ultimate outcome instead of by the quality of the decision at the time it was made, given what was known at that time. This is an error because no decision maker ever knows whether or not a calculated risk will turn out for the best. Individuals whose judgments are influenced by Outcome Bias are seemingly holding decision makers responsible for events beyond their control. The reason why an individual makes this mistake is that he or she will incorporate presently available information when evaluating a past decision. 

Baron and Hershey (1988) presented subjects with hypothetical situations in order to test this. One such example involved a surgeon deciding whether or not to do a risky surgery on a patient. The surgery had a known probability of success. Subjects were presented with either a good or bad outcome (in this case living or dying), and asked to rate the quality of the surgeon's pre-operation decision. Those presented with bad outcomes rated the decision worse than those who were presented with good outcomes.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_bias
Planning Fallacy,"The Planning Fallacy is a tendency for people and organizations to underestimate how long they will need to complete a task, even when they have past experience of similar tasks overrunning. The bias only affects predictions about one's own tasks; when uninvolved observers predict task completion times, they show a pessimistic bias, overestimating the time taken. In 2003, Lovallo and Kahneman proposed an expanded definition as the tendency to underestimate the time, costs, and risks of future actions and at the same time overestimate the benefits of the same actions. 

In a 1994 study, 37 psychology students were asked to estimate how long it would take to finish their senior theses. The average estimate was 33.9 days. They also estimated how long it would take ""if everything went as well as it possibly could"" (averaging 27.4 days) and ""if everything went as poorly as it possibly could"" (averaging 48.6 days). The average actual completion time was 55.5 days, with only about 30% of the students completing their thesis in the amount of time they predicted.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_fallacy
Post-purchase Rationalization,"A special case of Choice-supportive Bias, someone who purchases an expensive product or service overlooks any faults or defects in order to justify their purchase. 

For example, a consumer cannot decide between two popular video game consoles, A and B, but in the end decides to purchase product A on the basis that many of their peers also own this console. After purchasing it, he finds out that product A has a minimal amount of games and product B has more titles that the consumer would like to play. However, he does not wish to feel that he made the wrong decision, and so will attempt to convince himself and his peers that product A is better than product B.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-purchase_rationalization
Pseudo-certainty Effect,"A person's tendency to perceive an outcome as certain while in fact it is uncertain, or the tendency to make risk-averse choices if the expected outcome is positive, but make risk-seeking choices to avoid negative outcomes. For example, when considering multi-stage decisions, subjects may assume the first stage will go in their favor and only focus on the probability of the second stage of the process. A subject's evaluation of outcomes in a previous decision stage is discarded when making a choice in subsequent stages.

FYI - There is a very long and specific math-oriented example",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocertainty_effect
Reactance,"An emotional reaction in direct contradiction to rules or regulations that threaten or eliminate specific behavioral freedoms. Reactance can cause a person to adopt or strengthen a view or attitude that is contrary to what was intended, and also increases resistance to persuasion. 

An example of such behavior can be observed when an individual engages in a prohibited activity in order to deliberately taunt the authority who prohibits it, regardless of the utility or disutility that the activity confers. There are four important elements to reactance theory: perceived freedom, threat to freedom, reactance, and restoration of freedom. Freedom is not an abstract consideration, but rather a feeling associated with real behaviors, including actions, emotions, and attitudes. 

One study concluded that one way to increase the activity of a threatened freedom is to censor it, or provide a threatening message toward the activity. In turn a ""boomerang effect"" occurs, in which people choose forbidden alternatives. This study also shows that social influence has better results when it does not threaten one's core freedoms. Two concepts revealed in this study are that a communicator may be able to increase the positive force toward compliance by increasing his or her credibility, and that increasing the positive communication force and decreasing the negative communication force simultaneously should increase compliance.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactance_%28psychology%29
Restraint Bias,The tendency to overestimate one's own ability to show restraint in the face of temptation.,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restraint_bias
Selective Perception,"Selective Perception may refer to any number of cognitive biases in psychology related to the way expectations affect perception. For instance, several studies have shown that students who were told that they were consuming alcoholic beverages (which in fact were non-alcoholic) perceived themselves as being ""drunk"", exhibited fewer physiological symptoms of social stress, and drove a simulated car similarly to other subjects who had actually consumed alcohol. The result is somewhat similar to the Placebo Effect.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_perception
Semmelweis Reflex,"The tendency to reject new evidence that contradicts an established paradigm. There is some uncertainty regarding the origin and generally accepted use of the expression. It refers to Ignaz Semmelweis, who discovered that child-bed fever mortality rates could be reduced ten-fold if doctors would wash their hands (we would now say disinfect) with a chlorine solution between having contact with infected patients and non-infected patients. His hand-washing suggestions were rejected by his contemporaries.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semmelweis_reflex
Social Comparison Bias,"When making hiring decisions, people tend to favor potential candidates who don't compete with their own particular strengths.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_comparison_bias
Status Quo Bias,"A cognitive bias for the status quo; in other words, people tend not to change an established behavior unless the incentive to change is compelling. The US states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania inadvertently ran a real life experiment providing evidence of the Status Quo Bias in the early 1990s. As part of Tort law reform programs, citizens were offered two options for their automotive insurance: an expensive option giving them full right to sue, and a less expensive option with restricted rights to sue. In New Jersey the cheaper option was the default and most citizens selected it, while only a minority chose it in Pennsylvania where the more expensive option was the default. Similar effects have been shown for contributions to retirement plans, choice of internet privacy policies and the decision to become an organ donor.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo_bias
Unit Bias,The tendency to want to finish a given unit of a task or an item. Strong effects on the consumption of food in particular.,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases
Wishful Thinking,"The formation of beliefs and making decisions according to what might be pleasing to imagine instead of by appealing to evidence, rationality or reality. Studies have consistently shown that, holding all else equal, subjects will predict positive outcomes to be more likely than negative outcomes. This logical fallacy has the form ""I wish that P is true/false, therefore P is true/false.""",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wishful_thinking
Zero-risk Bias,"Zero-risk Bias occurs when individuals value complete elimination of a risk, however small, to a reduction in a greater risk. That is, individuals may prefer small benefits that are certain to large ones that are uncertain, regardless of the size of the ""certain"" benefit.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-risk_bias
Ambiguity Effect,"A cognitive bias where decision making is affected by a lack of information, or ""ambiguity"". The effect implies that people tend to select options for which the probability of a favorable outcome is known, instead of an option for which the probability of a favorable outcome is unknown. 

FYI - The only example is a lengthy probability problem",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambiguity_effect
Availability Cascade,A self-reinforcing cycle that explains the development of certain kinds of collective beliefs. A novel idea or insight (usually one that seems to explain a complex process in a simple or straightforward manner) gains rapid currency in the popular discourse because of its very simplicity and apparent insightfulness.,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_cascade
Availability Heuristic,"A phenomenon (which can result in a cognitive bias) in which people predict the frequency of an event, or a proportion within a population, based on how easily an example can be brought to mind. 

For example, when asked to rate the probability of a variety of causes of death, people tend to rate more ""newsworthy"" events as more likely because they can more readily recall an example from memory. For example, in the USA, people may rate the chance of death by homicide higher than the chance of death by stomach cancer, even though death by stomach cancer is five times higher than death by homicide.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic
Base Rate Neglect,"Base Rate Neglect, or Base Rate Fallacy or Bias, is an error that occurs when the conditional probability of some hypothesis H, given some evidence E, is assessed without taking into account the ""base rate"" or ""prior probability"" of H and the total probability of evidence E. 

In some experiments, students were asked to estimate the grade point averages (GPAs) of hypothetical students. When given relevant statistics about GPA distribution, students tended to ignore them if given descriptive information about the particular student, even if the new descriptive information was obviously of little or no relevance to school performance. 

Psychologists attempted to explain this finding in terms of the Representativeness Heuristic. Others have argued that some attributional biases like the fundamental attribution error are instances of the Base Rate Fallacy: people under-utilize ""consensus information"" (the ""base rate"") about how others behaved in similar situations and instead prefer simpler dispositional attributions.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy
Belief Bias,"An effect where someone's evaluation of the logical strength of an argument is affected by whether or not the conclusion is believable. 

In a series of experiments, subjects were presented with deductive arguments (in each of which a series of premises and a conclusion are given) and asked to indicate if each conclusion necessarily follows from the premises given. In other words, the subjects are asked to make an evaluation of logical validity. The subjects, however, exhibited belief bias when they rejected valid arguments with unbelievable conclusions, and endorsed invalid arguments with believable conclusions. It seems that instead of following directions and assessing logical validity, the subjects based their assessments on personal beliefs.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief_bias
Clustering Illusion,"The tendency to see patterns where actually none exist. Thomas Gilovich found that most people saw non-random sequences in the string of random data: OXXXOXXXOXXOOOXOOXXOO.
",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_illusion
Conjunction Fallacy,"A logical fallacy that occurs when it is assumed that specific conditions are more probable than a single general one. In one experiment, subjects were presented with the following scenario: Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations.

  Which is more probable?

    1. Linda is a bank teller.
    2. Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.

85% of those asked chose option 2. However the probability of two events occurring together (in ""conjunction"") is always less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring alone. But in another study, the question is rephrased in a more concrete format, and participants are likely to get the answer right. This demonstrates that it may be a result of poor word choice, rather than bias, that causes subjects to create unrealistic associations.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_fallacy
Forward Bias,The tendency to create models based on past data which are validated only against that past data.,http://visayanatheists.wordpress.com/2011/05/12/list-of-cognitive-biases/
Gambler's Fallacy,"The belief that if deviations from expected behavior are observed in repeated independent trials of some random process, future deviations in the opposite direction are then more likely. While the probability of a run of five heads is only 1⁄32 = 0.03125, it is only that before the coin is first tossed. After the first four tosses the results are no longer unknown, so their probabilities are 1. Reasoning that it is more likely that the next toss will be a tail than a head due to the past tosses, that a run of luck in the past somehow influences the odds in the future, is the fallacy.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy
Hindsight Bias,"Hindsight Bias, also known as the ""knew-it-all-along"" effect, is the inclination to see events that have already occurred as being more predictable than they were before they took place. This bias is recognized with the expression ""hindsight is 20/20"".

In one study, participants were given a short story with four possible outcomes. They are told that one of the outcomes is the ""true"" outcome, and are then asked to assign the likelihood of each particular outcome. Participants frequently assign a higher likelihood of occurrence to whichever outcome they have been told is true.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias
Illusory Correlation,"The phenomenon of seeing the relationship one expects in a set of data even when no such relationship exists. 

This bias can be caused by, among other things, an event that stands out as unique. Variables capture the attention simply because they are novel or deviant. This is one way stereotypes form and endure. David Hamilton and Terrence Rose (1980) found that stereotypes can lead people to expect certain groups and traits to fit together, and they overestimate the frequency of when these correlations actually occur. People overestimate the core association between variables such as stereotyped groups and stereotypical behavior.

Rupert Brown and Amanda Smith (1989) tested the hypothesis by conducting a study involving the academic staff at a British university. The results revealed that the staff had overestimated the number of female seniority staff and underestimated the number of male senior staff. This reflected that the academic staff inaccurately viewed the relationship between gender and seniority, showing that illusory correlations can exist in everyday situations.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_correlation
Observer-expectancy Effect,"This is when a researcher (or individual) expects a given result and therefore subconsciously manipulates an experiment or misinterprets data in order to find it. 

An example of the Observer-expectancy Effect is demonstrated in music back-masking, in which hidden verbal messages are said to be audible when a recording is played backwards. Often when a song is played backwards, a listener will fail to notice the ""hidden"" lyrics until they are explicitly pointed out, after which they are obvious.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer-expectancy_effect
Optimism Bias,"The demonstrated tendency for people to be overly optimistic about the outcome of planned actions. This includes over-estimating the likelihood of positive events and under-estimating the likelihood of negative events.

Armor and Taylor review a number of studies that have found optimism bias in different kinds of judgment. These include:

  - Second-year MBA students overestimated the number of job offers they would receive and their starting salary;
  - Students overestimated the scores they would achieve on exams;
  - Almost all newlyweds in a US study expected their marriage to last a lifetime, even while aware of divorce statistics;
  - Professional financial analysts consistently overestimated corporate earnings;
  - Most smokers believe they are less at risk of developing smoking-related diseases than others who smoke.

Companies have exploited this bias by increasing interest rates to punitive rates for any late payment, knowing that overconfidence causes many people to grossly underestimate their odds of making a payment late.
",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias
Ostrich Effect,"The Ostrich Effect is the tendency to avoid apparently risky (financial) situations by pretending they do not exist. The name comes from the common (but false) legend that ostriches bury their heads in the sand to avoid danger.

Research by Loewenstein and Duane Seppi determined that people in Scandinavia looked up the value of their investments 50% to 80% less often during bad markets.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrich_effect
Overconfidence Effect,"Excessive confidence in one's own answers to questions. The Overconfidence Effect is one of the most important and well-studied cognitive biases in psychology and behavioral economics. Overconfidence has been studied in three different ways:

  1. Overestimation of one's performance, ability, level of control, or rate of work; 
  2. An inflated belief that one is better than others, or over-placement; and
  3. An excessive belief in the truth and accuracy of one’s beliefs, or over-precision.

One is example is shown in a spelling task, where subjects were correct about 80% of the time when they were ""100% certain."" Put another way, the error rate was 20% when subjects expected it to be 0%.

"Positive Outcome Bias / Valence Effect","A person's tendency to overestimate the probability of a favorable outcome in a given situation.

In one experiment, all other things being equal, participants assigned a higher probability to picking a card that had a smiling face on its reverse side than one which had a frowning face.

Also known as the Valence Effect. The outcome of valence effects may be called ""wishful thinking"".",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_effect
Pareidolia,"A vague and random stimulus (often an image or sound) is perceived as significant, e.g., seeing images of animals or faces in clouds, the man in the moon, and hearing hidden messages on records played in reverse.

Pareidolia is why we find a ""face"" when we look at two dots and a line arranged inside of a circle.

Carl Sagan hypothesized that as a survival technique, human beings are ""hard-wired"" from birth to identify the human face. This allows people to use only minimal details to recognize faces from a distance and in poor visibility, but can also lead them to interpret random images or patterns of light and shade as being faces. The evolutionary advantages of being able to identify friend from foe with split-second accuracy are numerous. For example, prehistoric (and even modern) men and women who accidentally identify an enemy as a friend could face deadly consequences for this mistake. This is only one among many evolutionary pressures responsible for the development of the modern facial recognition capability of modern humans.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia
Pessimism Bias,"The tendency for some people, especially those suffering from depression, to overestimate the likelihood of negative things happening to them.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pessimism_bias
Primacy Effect,"The tendency to weigh or remember initial events or information more than subsequent events or information. For example, a subject who reads a sufficiently long list of words is more likely to remember words toward the beginning than words in the middle (though words at the end of the list may be even more memorable).",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primacy_effect#Primacy_effect
Recency Effect,"The tendency to weigh recent events more than earlier events. There are two models that may explain this effect. The Duo Store Model suggests that items stored in short term memory are more readily accessible, and therefore the most recent information a person has reviewed will be most available and weighed most heavily. The Single Store Model suggests that either recent information is most distinct or that it is most closely associated with the ""test"" where the information is needed, and therefore most recent information is more easily accessible.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recency_effect#Recency_effect
Disregard of Regression toward the Mean,"The tendency to expect extreme performance to continue, despite the fact that it is most likely for performance to be closer to average overall as it continues.

When things happen to deviate from the mean by chance, you assume the abnormal behavior will continue.

""""When his pain got worse, he went to a doctor, after which the pain subsided somewhat. Therefore, he benefited from the doctor's treatment.""""
 
This assumes the pain would have continued without the doctors treatment.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean
Stereotyping,"Expecting a member of a group to have certain characteristics without having actual information about that individual.

The term ""stereotype"" derives from the Greek words στερεός (stereos), meaning ""firm, solid"", and τύπος (typos), meaning ""impression,"" hence: ""solid impression"". It was originally a term used in the world of printing to describe a duplicate impression of an original typographical element, used for printing instead of the original.

There are many theories about why individuals tend to stereotype. One theory is that stereotyping is the most convenient way to sort information - grouping large numbers of people and experiences together. It could also be the case that one's childhood experiences are primary in the creation of stereotypes, and these stereotypes learned in childhood are self-perpetuating, growing stronger as an individual ages. A third theory focuses on an individual's need to feel good about him or herself. If I am part of Group A, and Group A is ""right"" about everything, then it is best for my self esteem to lump other individuals into separate, inferior groups.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotyping
Subadditivity,"The tendency to judge the probability of the whole to be less than the sum of the probabilities of the component parts.

For instance, subjects in one experiment judged that the probability of death from cancer in the United States was 18%, the probability from heart attack was 22%, and the probability of death from ""other natural causes"" was 33%. Other participants judged that the probability of death from a natural cause was 58%. Natural causes are made up precisely of cancer, heart attack, and ""other natural causes,"" however, the sum of the latter three probabilities was 73%, and not 58%. According to Tversky and Koehler (1994) this kind of result is observed consistently.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subadditivity_effect
Subjective Validation,"The perception that something is true if a subject's belief demands it to be true. Also assigns perceived connections between coincidences. In other words, a person whose opinion is affected by Subjective Validation will perceive two unrelated events (i.e., a coincidence) to be related because their personal belief demands that they be related.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_validation
Well-travelled Road Effect,The Well-travelled Road Effect is a cognitive bias in which travellers will estimate the time taken to traverse routes differently depending on their familiarity with the route. Frequently travelled routes are assessed as taking a shorter time than unfamiliar routes.,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well_travelled_road_effect
Actor-observer Asymmetry,"Actors, those assessing their own behavior, tend to emphasize the influence of the situation and the situation's effect on their behavior, and under-emphasize the influence of their own character. When observing others' actions, observers tend to emphasize aspects of behavior and personality, and how those characteristics lead to a behavior, rather than the situation's influence.

This has been demonstrated in studies by differentiating between actors' and observers' explanations in the following way: people's explanations are separated into theoretically meaningful distinctions (e.g., reasons vs. causal history of reason explanations). Then responses can be effectively categorized, and the differences emerge.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor%E2%80%93observer_bias
Dunning–Kruger Effect,"The unskilled suffer from illusory superiority, rating their ability as above average (much higher than it actually is), while the highly skilled underrate their own abilities, suffering from illusory inferiority, as they assume others have a similar understanding. As Kruger and Dunning noted, ""the miscalibration of the incompetent stems from an error about the self, whereas the miscalibration of the highly competent stems from an error about others"".

Dunning and Kruger concluded, ""across four studies, the authors found that participants scoring in the bottom quartile on tests of humor, grammar, and logic grossly overestimated their test performance and ability. Although test scores put them in the 12th percentile, they estimated themselves to be in the 62nd."" Meanwhile, people with true ability tended to underestimate their relative competence. Roughly, participants who found tasks to be relatively easy erroneously assumed, to some extent, that the tasks must also be easy for others.

Studies on the Dunning–Kruger Effect tend to focus on American test subjects. Similar studies on European subjects show marked muting of the effect; studies on some East Asian subjects suggest that something like the opposite of the Dunning–Kruger effect operates on self-assessment and motivation to improve.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect
Egocentric Bias,This occurs when people claim more personal responsibility for the results of a joint action than an outside observer would credit them. This is unique because they will take an unfair share of credit for both positive and negative results.,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egocentric_bias
Forer (or Barnum) Effect,"The tendency to believe that a description of your own personality is accurate despite the fact that it is vague enough to apply to a wide range of people. 

In 1948, psychologist Bertram R. Forer gave a personality test to his students. He told his students they were each receiving a unique personality analysis that was based on the test's results and to rate their analysis on a scale of 0 (very poor) to 5 (excellent) on how well it applied to themselves. In reality, each received the same analysis. On average, the rating was 4.26, but only after the ratings were turned in was it revealed that each student had received identical copies assembled by Forer from various horoscopes.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forer_effect
False Consensus Effect,"A person tends to overestimate how much other people agree with him or her. There is a tendency for people to assume that their own opinions, beliefs, preferences, values, and habits are 'normal', and that others also think the same way that they think. This can either lead a person to believe that his opinions are shared by the majority, or, even if he is aware that they are not shared by the majority, he will overestimate the number of people with whom he shares the opinion. Additionally, when confronted with evidence that a consensus does not exist, people often assume that those who do not agree with them are defective in some way.

This bias can be traced back to primarily two roots. According to social comparison, individuals evaluate their thoughts and attitudes based on other people, and often look towards others to find a ""norm"" by which they may judge themselves. The problem, though, is that people are often unable to accurately perceive the social norm and the actual attitudes of others. Due to projection, a person may see aspects of himself in others, whether accurate, imagined, or exaggerated.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_consensus_effect
Fundamental Attribution Error,"The tendency for people to over-emphasize personality-based explanations for behaviors observed in others while under-emphasizing the role and power of situational influences on the same behavior. Similar to Actor-observer Bias, but in this case the focus is on a person's interpretation of others' actions, rather than of one's own actions.

Jones and Harris hypothesized that people would attribute apparently freely-chosen behaviors to disposition, and apparently chance-directed behaviors to situation. The hypothesis was confounded by the Fundamental Attribution Error. Subjects read pro- and anti-Fidel Castro essays, and were then asked to rate the pro-Castro attitudes of the writers. When the subjects believed that the writers freely chose the positions they took (for or against Castro), they naturally rated the people who spoke in favor of Castro as having a more positive attitude towards Castro. However, contradicting Jones's and Harris's initial hypothesis, when the subjects were told that the writers' positions were determined by a coin toss, they still rated writers who spoke in favor of Castro as having, on average, a more positive attitude towards Castro than did those who spoke against him. In other words, the subjects were unable to see the influence of the situational constraints placed upon the writers; they could not refrain from attributing sincere belief to the writers.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error
Halo Effect,"The perception of one trait (i.e. a characteristic of a person or object) is influenced by the perception of another trait (or several traits) of that person or object. An example would be judging a good-looking person as more intelligent.

In a psychology study published in 1920, Thorndike asked commanding officers to rate their soldiers; he found high cross-correlation between all positive and all negative traits. People seem not to think of other individuals in mixed terms; instead we seem to see each person as roughly good or roughly bad across all categories of measurement.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect
Illusion of Asymmetric Insight,"People perceive their knowledge of their peers to surpass their peers' knowledge of them. Furthermore, a group of people often assumes that they know more about other groups than other groups know about them. The source for this bias seems to stem from the fact that observed behaviors of others are more revealing than one's own similar behaviors.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_asymmetric_insight
Illusion of Transparency,"A tendency for people to overestimate the degree to which their personal mental state is known by others. Another manifestation of the Illusion of Transparency (sometimes called the Observer's Illusion of Transparency) is a tendency for people to overestimate how well they understand others' personal mental states.

Initial anxiety in a public speaking situation can cause stress that, because of the Illusion of Transparency, the speaker may feel is evident to the listeners. This mistaken perception can cause the speaker to compensate, which he or she then feels is even more obvious to the crowd, and the stress increases in a feedback loop. Awareness of the limits of others' perceptions of one's mental state can help break the cycle and reduce speech anxiety.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_transparency
Illusory Superiority,"Overestimating one's desirable qualities, and underestimating undesirable qualities, relative to other people. (Also known as ""Lake Wobegon Effect,"" ""Better-than-average Effect,"" or ""Superiority Bias""). 

In Kruger and Dunning's experiments, participants were given specific tasks (such as logic problems, grammar, and determining whether or not jokes were funny), and were asked to evaluate their performance on these tasks relative to the rest of the group, enabling a direct comparison of their actual and perceived performance. Results were divided into four groups, depending on actual performance. It was found that all four groups evaluated their performance as above average, meaning that the lowest-scoring group (the bottom 25%) showed a very large Illusory Superiority Bias. The researchers attributed this to the fact that the individuals who were worst at performing the tasks were also worst at recognizing skill in those tasks. This was supported by the fact that, given training, the worst subjects improved their estimate of their rank as well as getting better at the tasks.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority
In-group Bias,"The tendency for people to give preferential treatment to others they perceive to be members of their own groups.

The need to improve self esteem may be one cause of this bias: individuals will find a reason, no matter how insignificant, to prove to themselves why their group is superior. By having a more positive impression of individuals in the in-group, individuals are able to boost their own self-esteem as members of that group.

Robert Cialdini and his research team looked at the number of university T-shirts being worn on college campuses following either a win or loss at the football game. Not surprisingly, the Monday after a win there were more T-shirts being worn, on average, than following a loss.

The bias may lead to inter-group aggression, competition, and prejudice. ",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingroup_bias
Just-world Phenomenon,"The tendency for people to want to believe that the world is fundamentally just. As a result, when they witness an otherwise inexplicable injustice, they rationalize it by searching for things that the victim might have done to deserve it, often at the expense of blaming victims for things that were not, objectively, their fault.

One cause of this phenomenon may be the need to protect one's own sense of invulnerability. They want to believe that if the potential victim avoids the behaviors of the past victims, then they themselves will remain safe.

In one study, female and male subjects were told two versions of a story about an interaction between a woman and a man. Both variations were exactly the same, except one ending was that the man raped the woman, and in the other he proposed marriage. In both conditions, both female and male subjects viewed the woman's (identical) actions as inevitably leading to the (very different) results.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-world_phenomenon
Moral Luck,"The tendency for people to ascribe greater or lesser moral standing based on the outcome of an event rather than on the intention. For example, if two drivers run two different red lights, and, all else being equal, one of them hits a person who was crossing the street while the other gets only a traffic ticket, we want to say that the driver who hit a person is more morally corrupt. Both drivers committed the same offense, but under different circumstances. ",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_luck
Out-group Homogeneity Bias,"One perceives out-group members as being more similar to one another than are in-group members. The notion is that ""they are alike; we are diverse."" 

This bias was found to be unrelated to the number of group and non-group members individuals knew. For example, the Out-group Homogeneity Bias was found between groups such as ""men"" and ""women,"" despite the fact that members of each group interact with one another frequently.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outgroup_homogeneity_bias
Projection Bias,"A psychological defense mechanism where a person subconsciously denies his or her own attributes, thoughts, and emotions, which he or she then ascribes to the outside world, usually to another person or other people.

In one example posed by Sigmund Freud, a person might have thoughts of infidelity with respect to a spouse or other partner. Instead of dealing with these undesirable thoughts consciously, the subject unconsciously projects these feelings onto the other person, and begins to think that the other has thoughts of infidelity and that the other may be having an affair.

Projection can also be a means of justifying certain actions that would normally be found atrocious or heinous. This often means projecting false accusations, information, etc. for the sole purpose of maintaining a self-created illusion about one's own subconscious actions or feelings.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_bias
Self-serving Bias,"Occurs when people attribute their successes to internal or personal factors, but attribute their failures to situational factors beyond their control. The Self-serving Bias can be seen in the common human tendency to take credit for success but to deny responsibility for failure. 

One example of Self-serving Bias can be found in the workplace. Victims of serious occupational accidents tend to attribute their accidents to external factors, whereas their coworkers and management tend to attribute the accidents to the victims' own actions.

There are several possible causes of this bias. People are motivated to protect their self-esteem; they may be attempting to protect their reputation by advertising successes and shifting blame for failures publicly, regardless of their true understanding of the situation. Additionally, success may be more readily available to memory than failure.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-serving_bias
System Justification,"A scientific theory within social psychology that proposes that people have a motivation to defend and bolster the status quo, i.e., to see it as good, legitimate, and desirable.

Early SJT (Situational Judgment Tests) research focused on compensatory stereotypes. Experiments suggested that the widespread endorsement of stereotypes such as ""poor but happy"" or ""rich but miserable"" exist to balance out the gap between those of low and high socioeconomic status. Later work suggested that these compensatory stereotypes are preferred by leftists while rightists prefer non-complimentary stereotypes such as ""poor and dishonest"" or ""rich and honest"", which rationalize inequality rather than compensate for it.

This differs from the Status Quo Bias because it is predominately motivational, rather than cognitive. It is considered to be motivational because its effects are exacerbated when people are under psychological threat, or when they feel their outcomes are especially dependent on the system that is being justified.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_justification
Ultimate Attribution Error,"This is a bias that people commonly have toward members of an out-group. Similar to the Fundamental Attribution Error, in this error a person is likely to make an internal attribution to an entire group instead of the individuals within the group. For example, they may view negative acts committed by out-group members as a stable trait of the out-group, and positive acts committed by out-group members as exceptions to normal behavior. It is considered to be one of the roots of prejudice.

In his 1976 demonstration, Birt Duncan asked White participants to watch a video of a man shoving another man. One video had a Caucasian male shoving another Caucasian male and a second video had an African American male shoving a Caucasian male. When the participants watched the first video they concluded that the Caucasian male doing the shoving was attributed to having fun (a situational factor), but when they watched the second video they attributed the African American’s behavior to an aggressive personality (Duncan, 1979). The results of Duncan's study demonstrates that ultimate attribution error is more likely to occur when there are negative associations with members of an out-group due to previous conflict or certain situations that were experienced (Whitley & Kite, 2010).",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_attribution_error
Trait Ascription Bias,"The tendency for people to view themselves as relatively variable in terms of personality, behavior and mood while viewing others as much more predictable. This may be because our own internal states are much more observable and available to us than those of others.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait_ascription_bias
Inoculation Effect,"When we hear bad arguments (that we know are bad) in favor of a hypothesis, we may end up believing that hypothesis less, even though we have not necessarily heard any of the good arguments in favor of the hypothesis. It seems to us that if the bad arguments for a hypothesis are wrong, the hypothesis is likely to be false, even though how likely something is to be true hinges on the best arguments for it, not the worst.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation_theory
Backtracking Effect,"People are less happy doing things that involve undoing what they did previously than spending the same amount of time doing extra work that does not involve backtracking. 

This is related to Trial and Error. For example, consider coming cross a fork in a road. You decide to take route A instead of route B. Halfway down the path, you realize you are going the wrong way and need to take route B. Backtracking can also occur when solving puzzles, such as Sudoku or crossword puzzles.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking
Precision/Accuracy Bias,"People believe that numbers that are stated more precisely (e.g. 75.1259) are more accurate than numbers that are not (e.g. 75). While precision (e.g. lots of decimal points) is necessary for very high levels of accuracy, precision does not necessarily imply accuracy, and when calculators or computers are used to compute quantities, high precision numbers are trivially easy to produce.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_bias
Handedness Bias,"Our tendency to prefer objects (or attribute better qualities to them) when they are presented on the strong side of our bodies (the right side for right handed people, and the left side for left handed people).",http://www.sott.net/articles/show/241582-Different-Bodies-Different-Minds-The-Handedness-Bias
Fallacy of Difference,"The tendency to attribute the outcome of a situation to whatever traits make that situation most unusual.

For instance, if you're friend and his wife get a divorce, you might assume that it was due to the fact that they were in an open marriage (a trait that made their marriage stand out as unusual), rather than taking into account the fact that it is common for relationships of all types to end.",http://rationallyspeaking.blogspot.com/2011/07/fallacy-of-difference-in-science-and.html

"Temporal Discounting","This is similar to Hyperbolic Discounting in that subjects prefer benefits or rewards sooner rather than later, which may lead to Dynamic Inconsistency: how each different self of a decision-maker may have different preferences over current and future choices. For example, a decision maker holds the view that ""now"" has especially high value compared to any future time. This Temporal Discounting is a tendency to give greater value to rewards as they move away from their temporal horizons and towards the ""now"". For instance, a nicotine-deprived smoker may highly value a cigarette available any time in the next 6 hours but assign little or no value to a cigarette available in 6 months.","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_inconsistency
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_discounting"
Disjunction Fallacy,"The use of the Representativeness Heuristic may lead to a Disjunction Fallacy. From probability theory, the disjunction of two events is at least as likely as either of the events individually. For example, the probability of being either a physics or a biology major is at least as likely as being a physics major, if not more likely. However, when a personality description (data) seems to be very representative of a physics major (e.g., pocket protector) over a biology major, people judge that it is more likely for this person to be a physics major than a natural sciences major (which is a superset of physics).

Further evidence that the Representativeness Heuristic may be causal to the Disjunction Fallacy comes from Bar-Hillel and Neter (1986). They found that people judge a person who is highly representative of being a statistics major (e.g., highly intelligent, does math competitions) as being more likely to be a statistics major than a social sciences major (superset of statistics), but they do not think that he is more likely to be a Hebrew language major than a humanities major (superset of Hebrew language). Thus, only when the person seems highly representative of a category is that category judged as more probable than its superordinate category. These incorrect appraisals remained even in the face of losing real money in bets on probabilities.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/representativeness_heuristic

Typical Mind Fallacy,"There was a debate, in the late 1800s, about whether ""imagination"" was simply a turn of phrase or a real phenomenon. That is, can people actually create images in their minds which they see vividly, or do they simply say ""I saw it in my mind"" as a metaphor for considering what it looked like?

The debate was resolved by Francis Galton, who among other achievements invented eugenics, the ""wisdom of crowds"", and standard deviation. Galton gave people some very detailed surveys, and found that some people did have mental imagery and others did not. The ones who did simply assumed everyone did, and the ones who didn't simply assumed everyone didn't, to the point of coming up with absurd justifications for why they were lying or misunderstanding the question. There was a wide spectrum of imaging ability, from about five percent of people with perfect eidetic imagery to three percent of people completely unable to form mental images.",http://lesswrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/
Fallacy of Grey / Gray,"  The Sophisticate: ""The world isn't black and white. No one does pure good or pure bad. It's all gray. Therefore, no one is better than anyone else.""
  The Zetet: ""Knowing only gray, you conclude that all grays are the same shade. You mock the simplicity of the two-color view, yet you replace it with a one-color view...""
   —Marc Stiegler, David's Sling

Everything is shades of gray, but there are shades of gray so light as to be very nearly white, and shades of gray so dark as to be very nearly black. Or even if not, we can still compare shades, and say ""it is darker"" or ""it is lighter"".

The Fallacy of Gray is a belief that because nothing is certain, everything is equally uncertain. One who commits this fallacy may reply to the statement that odds of two to the power of seven hundred and fifty million to one, against, meant ""there was still a chance"".

This fallacy is invoked by those who wish to attack a well performing system (e.g. science), by saying that it is still imperfect. This then excuses the imperfections of the invoker's chosen system. For example ""Science is based on faith too!""","http://lesswrong.com/lw/mm/the_fallacy_of_gray/

Childhood Amnesia in Memory,"The retention of few memories from before the age of four. This is a scarcity that cannot be accounted for by a forgetting curve. Additionally, the boundary is malleable and can be influenced by both
individual experiences and cultural factors.

It has been suggested that the average age of the first memories is three years, six months, with the vast majority of subjects dating their first recollection somewhere between ages two and five years. Very few memories of adults precede 30 months, and those that are reported at this time show considerable confabulation with individuals unable to tell the difference between a memory of an event and simple knowledge of the event (i.e. gained from discussion by others).",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood_amnesia
Context Effect in Memory,"That cognition and memory are dependent on context, such that out-of-context memories are more difficult to retrieve than in-context memories (e.g., recall time and accuracy for a work-related memory will be lower at home, and vice versa)

Context-dependent cues are dependent on the environment and situation. Memory retrieval can be facilitated or triggered by replication of the context in which the memory was encoded. Such conditions include weather, company, location, smelling of a particular odor, hearing a certain song, even taste can sometimes act as a cue. For example, students sometimes fail to recall diligently studied material when an examination room's environmental conditions differ significantly from the room or place where learning occurred. To improve learning and recall, it is recommended that students should study under conditions that closely resemble an examination. Psychologists that have researched context dependent recall include Abernathy (1940), as well as Godden & Baddeley (1975).",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-dependent_memory
Fading Affect Bias in Memory,"A bias in which the emotion associated with unpleasant memories fades more quickly than the emotion associated with positive events.

""Life Is Pleasant - and Memory Helps to Keep It That Way!""",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_memory_biases
Hindsight Bias in Memory,"Hindsight Bias is the inclination to see events that have already occurred as being more predictable than they were before they took place

Beyth and Fischoff devised the first experiment directly testing the hindsight bias. They asked participants to judge the likelihood of several outcomes of President Nixon's upcoming visit to Peking (also known as Beijing) and Moscow. Some time after President Nixon's return, participants were asked to recall, or reconstruct the probabilities they had assigned to each possible outcome, and their perceptions of likelihood of each outcome was greater or overestimated for events that actually had occurred.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight
Humor Effect in Memory,"That humorous items are more easily remembered than non-humorous ones, which might be explained by the distinctiveness of humor, the increased cognitive processing time to understand the humor, or the emotional arousal caused by the humor.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_memory_biases
(Self) Generation Effect in Memory,"The Generation Effect refers to the robust finding that information will be better remembered if it is generated rather than simply read. For example, you are more likely to remember the word ""orangutan"" if you generate it from the fragment ""or_ng_ta_"" than if you simply see the word in its entirety.

The Generation Effect is usually achieved in cognitive psychology experiments where participants are asked to generate words from word fragments. It has also been demonstrated using a variety of other materials, such as when generating a word after being presented with its antonym or synonym, or generating keywords in paragraphs, pictures, and arithmetic problems. In addition, the generation effect has been found in studies using free recall, cued recall, and recognition tests.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_effect
Accuracy of our Memories of our Emotional Responses,"Oddly, we don't seem to learn all that much from our own experience. To learn from experience requires that we be able to remember it, and research shows that people are about as bad at remembering their past emotions as they are predicting their future emotions. That's why we make the same errors again and again. For example, in one of our studies, Democrats predicted they'd be devastated if Bush won the 2004 presidential election, and as we always find, they were not nearly as devastated as they predicted. But several months after the election, they remembered being just as devastated as they had expected to be. It turns out that this is a very common pattern of memory errors. Retrospection and prospection share many of the same biases, and hence reinforce each other.",http://www.randomhouse.com/kvpa/gilbert/qa.html
Illusion-of-truth Memory Bias,"People are more likely to identify as true statements those they have previously heard (even if they cannot consciously remember having heard them), regardless of the actual validity of the statement.

Part-set Cueing Effect in Memory,"Presenting a subset of previously learned items as retrieval ""cues"" often impairs recall for the remaining information. (Roediger, 1973)

Rosy Retrospection in Memory,"Rosy Retrospection refers to the finding that subjects later rate past events more positively than they had actually rated them when the event occurred; reminiscent of the Latin phrase ""memoria praeteritorum bonorum"" (""the past is always recalled to be good"").

The effect appears to be stronger with moderately pleasant events and is usually explained as a result of minor annoyances and dislikes ""fading"" from memory dramatically faster than positive situations.

Reference class forecasting (the method of predicting the future, through looking at similar past situations and their outcomes) was developed to eliminate or reduce the effect of rosy retrospection in decision making.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosy_retrospection
Telescoping Effect in Memory,"People's tendency to perceive recent events as being more remote than they are, and to perceive distant events as being more recent than they are. More specifically, the former is known as ""backward telescoping"", and the latter as ""forward telescoping"". Between backward and forward telescoping there lies a point at which events are just as likely to be displaced backward as forward in time.

The original work is usually attributed to a 1964 article by Neter and Waksberg in the Journal of the American Statistical Association.",http://www2.fiu.edu/~dwright/pdf/telescopepoq.pdf
Zeigarnik Effect in Memory,"States that people remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks.

Soviet psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik first studied the phenomenon after her professor, Gestalt psychologist Kurt Lewin, noticed that a waiter had better recollections of still unpaid orders.

In Gestalt psychology, the Zeigarnik effect has been used to demonstrate the general presence of Gestalt phenomena: not just appearing as perceptual effects, but also present in cognition.

The Zeigarnik effect suggests that students who ""suspend"" their study, during which they do unrelated activities (such as studying unrelated subjects or playing games), will remember material better than students who complete study sessions without a break (Zeigarnik, 1927; McKinney 1935).",http://www.psychwiki.com/wiki/Zeigarnik_Effect
